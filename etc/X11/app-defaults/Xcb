! Xcb application defaults resource file.
! ======================================================================


! The xcb widget hierarchy consists of a number of custom buffer
! widgets contained within a single Athena form widget.
! The widget names and classes are as follows:
!
! buffer widgets    name = "buffer<NN>"    class = "Buffer"
! form widget       name = "container"     class = "Form"



! Buffer widgets are numbered from 0... onwards, and are named accordingly.
! As well as the standard core resources, each buffer widget supports
! resources for "foreground" and "fontSet".

! Application wide resources are as follows:
!
! "bufferCount" (default value 8)
!    This is the number of buffer widgets to create.
!    Any number of widgets (greater than zero) can be created.
!
! "layout" (default value "h")
!    Only the first character of the resource value is significant.
!    This is the geometry arrangement to apply in the container widget.
!    The layout can be "h" (horizontal), "v" (vertical), or some
!    other value to disable the inbuilt geometry code and specify
!    the layout via your X resources.

Xcb.bufferCount:		8
Xcb.layout:			horizontal
Xcb*fontSet:			fixed
Xcb*borderWidth:		1
Xcb*Buffer.width:		60
Xcb*Buffer.height:		60


Xcb*container.defaultDistance:	0





! Below is an example of a layout scheme which arranges
! 10 cut buffer widgets in two rows of 5 windows.
! Refer to the "Athena Widget Set" manual for full details.
