Description: add and remove users and groups
 This package includes the 'adduser' and 'deluser' commands for creating
 and removing users.
 .
  - 'adduser' creates new users and groups and adds existing users to
    existing groups;
  - 'deluser' removes users and groups and removes users from a given
    group.
 .
 Adding users with 'adduser' is much easier than adding them manually.
 Adduser will choose appropriate UID and GID values, create a home
 directory, copy skeletal user configuration, and automate setting
 initial values for the user's password, real name and so on.
 .
 Deluser can back up and remove users' home directories
 and mail spool or all the files they own on the system.
 .
 A custom script can be executed after each of the commands.

Description: Tool for generating GNU Standards-compliant Makefiles
 Automake is a tool for automatically generating `Makefile.in's from
 files called `Makefile.am'.
 .
 The goal of Automake is to remove the burden of Makefile maintenance
 from the back of the individual GNU maintainer (and put it on the back
 of the Automake maintainer).
 .
 The `Makefile.am' is basically a series of `make' macro definitions
 (with rules being thrown in occasionally).  The generated
 `Makefile.in's are compliant with the GNU Makefile standards.
 .
 Automake 1.16 fails to work in a number of situations that Automake
 1.11, and 1.15 did, so some previous versions are available as separate
 packages.

Description: Support for extra binary formats
 The binfmt_misc kernel module, contained in versions 2.1.43 and later of the
 Linux kernel, allows system administrators to register interpreters for
 various binary formats based on a magic number or their file extension, and
 cause the appropriate interpreter to be invoked whenever a matching file is
 executed. Think of it as a more flexible version of the #! executable
 interpreter mechanism.
 .
 This package provides an 'update-binfmts' script with which package
 maintainers can register interpreters to be used with this module without
 having to worry about writing their own init.d scripts, and which sysadmins
 can use for a slightly higher-level interface to this module.

Description: collection of more utilities from FreeBSD
 This package contains lots of small programs many people expect to find when
 they use a BSD-style Unix system.
 .
 It provides banner (as printerbanner), calendar, col, colcrt, colrm, column,
 from (as bsd-from), hexdump (or hd), look, lorder, ncal (or cal), ul, and
 write (as bsd-write).
 .
 This package used to contain whois and vacation, which are now distributed in
 their own packages. Also here was tsort, which is now in the "coreutils"
 package.

Description: Informational list of build-essential packages
 If you do not plan to build Debian packages, you don't need this
 package.  Starting with dpkg (>= 1.14.18) this package is required
 for building Debian packages.
 .
 This package contains an informational list of packages which are
 considered essential for building Debian packages.  This package also
 depends on the packages on that list, to make it easy to have the
 build-essential packages installed.
 .
 If you have this package installed, you only need to install whatever
 a package specifies as its build-time dependencies to build the
 package.  Conversely, if you are determining what your package needs
 to build-depend on, you can always leave out the packages this
 package depends on.
 .
 This package is NOT the definition of what packages are
 build-essential; the real definition is in the Debian Policy Manual.
 This package contains merely an informational list, which is all
 most people need.   However, if this package and the manual disagree,
 the manual is correct.

Description: Tiny utilities for small and embedded systems
 BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single
 small executable. It provides minimalist replacements for the most common
 utilities you would usually find on your desktop system (i.e., ls, cp, mv,
 mount, tar, etc.). The utilities in BusyBox generally have fewer options than
 their full-featured GNU cousins; however, the options that are included
 provide the expected functionality and behave very much like their GNU
 counterparts.
 .
 This package installs the BusyBox binary but does not install
 symlinks for any of the supported utilities. Some of the utilities
 can be used in the system by installing the busybox-syslogd,
 busybox-udhcpc or busybox-udhcpd packages.

 considerably better than that achieved by more conventional
 LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM
 family of statistical compressors.

 is possible to support complex environments requiring system
 configuration, pre-processor generation, code generation, and template
 instantiation.
 .
 CMake was developed by Kitware as part of the NLM Insight
 Segmentation and Registration Toolkit project. The ASCI VIEWS project
 also provided support in the context of their parallel computation
 environment. Other sponsors include the Insight, VTK, and VXL open

Description: simple interprocess messaging system (daemon and utilities)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in

 .
 D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus
 decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be
 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using
 XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but
 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.
 .
 It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.
 .
 This package contains the D-Bus daemon and related utilities.
 .
 The client-side library can be found in the libdbus-1-3 package, as it is no
 longer contained in this package.

Description: simple interprocess messaging system (systemd --user integration)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 On systemd systems, this package opts in to the session model in which
 a user's session starts the first time they log in, and does not end
 until all their login sessions have ended. This model merges all
 parallel non-graphical login sessions (text mode, ssh, cron, etc.), and up
 to one graphical session, into a single "user-session" or "super-session"
 within which all background D-Bus services are shared.
 .
 Multiple graphical sessions per user are not currently supported in this
 mode; as a result, it is particularly suitable for gdm, which responds to
 requests to open a parallel graphical session by switching to the existing
 graphical session and unlocking it.
 .
 To retain dbus' traditional session semantics, in which login sessions
 are artificially isolated from each other, remove this package and install
 dbus-x11 instead.
 .
 See the dbus package description for more information about D-Bus in general.

Description: debhelper add-on to call autoreconf and clean up after the build
 dh-autoreconf provides a debhelper sequence addon named 'autoreconf' and two
 commands, dh_autoreconf and dh_autoreconf_clean.
 .
 The dh_autoreconf command creates a list of the files and their checksums,
 calls autoreconf and then creates a second list for the new files.
 .
 The dh_autoreconf_clean command compares these two lists and removes all
 files which have been added or changed (files may be excluded if needed).
 .
 For CDBS users, a rule is provided to call the dh-autoreconf programs at
 the right time.

Description: file non-deterministic information stripper — Debhelper add-on
 StripNondeterminism is a library for stripping non-deterministic information
 such as timestamps and filesystem ordering from various file and archive
 formats.
 .
 This can be used as a post-processing step to improve the reproducibility of a
 build product, when the build process itself cannot be made deterministic.
 .
 It is used as part of the Reproducible Builds project, although it should be
 considered a temporary workaround which should not be needed in the long
 term; upstream software should be reproducible even without using such a tool.
 .
 This package installs the ‘dh_strip_nondeterminism’ Debhelper command that
 strips nondeterminism as part of a Debian package build process.

Description: File comparison utilities
 The diffutils package provides the diff, diff3, sdiff, and cmp programs.
 .
 `diff' shows differences between two files, or each corresponding file
 in two directories.  `cmp' shows the offsets and line numbers where
 two files differ.  `cmp' can also show all the characters that
 differ between the two files, side by side.  `diff3' shows differences
 among three files.  `sdiff' merges two files interactively.
 .
 The set of differences produced by `diff' can be used to distribute
 updates to text files (such as program source code) to other people.
 This method is especially useful when the differences are small compared
 to the complete files.  Given `diff' output, the `patch' program can
 update, or "patch", a copy of the file.

Description: fast lexical analyzer generator
 Flex is a tool for generating scanners: programs which recognized lexical
 patterns in text. It reads the given input files for a description of a
 scanner to generate. The description is in the form of pairs of regular
 expressions and C code, called rules. Flex generates as output a C source
 file, lex.yy.c, which defines a routine yylex().  This file is compiled
 and linked with the -lfl library to produce an executable. When the
 executable is run, it analyzes its input for occurrences of the regular
 expressions. Whenever it finds one, it executes the corresponding C code.

Description: generic font configuration library - support binaries
 Fontconfig is a font configuration and customization library, which
 does not depend on the X Window System. It is designed to locate
 fonts within the system and select them according to requirements
 specified by applications.
 .
 Fontconfig is not a rasterization library, nor does it impose a
 particular rasterization library on the application. The X-specific
 library 'Xft' uses fontconfig along with freetype to specify and
 rasterize fonts.
 .
 This package contains a program to maintain the fontconfig cache
 (fc-cache), a sample program to list installed fonts (fc-list), a program
 to test the matching rules (fc-match) and a program to dump the binary
 cache files in string form (fc-cat). It no longer makes fonts managed by defoma
 available to fontconfig applications.

Description: greek font (Times Greek-like)
 The type family GFS Artemisia was designed by the painter-engraver
 Takis Katsoulidis and reflects his style and typographic acumen. It
 is largely his effort to offer, from a different perspective, a type
 face which, like Times Greek, would be applicable to a wide spectrum
 of uses and equally agreeable and legible. The typeface has been
 digitised by George D. Matthiopoulos.

 Former Greek types had harked back to classical models. In 1927,
 Victor Scholderer chose instead to revive one which had first
 appeared in a 1492 printing of Macrobius attributed to Joannes
 Rubeus. In 1993-4 the typeface was digitized by the Greek Font
 Society, with the addition of a new set of epigraphic symbols.

Description: ancient Greek oblique font revival (companion to GFS Didot)
 In Greece the terms italic and oblique have the same meaning since
 they are borrowed from the latin typographic practice without any
 real historical equivalent in Greek history. Until the end of the
 19th century Greek typefaces were cut and cast independently, not as
 members of a typefamily. The mechanisation of typecutting allowed the
 transformation of upright Greek typefaces to oblique designs.
 Nonetheless, the typesetting practice of a cursive Greek font to
 complement an upright one did not survive the 19th century. The
 experimental font GFS Olga (1995) attempts to revive this lost
 tradition. The typeface was designed and digitised by George
 Matthiopoulos, based on the historical Porson Greek type (1803) with
 the intention to be the companion of the upright GFS Didot font
 whenever there is a need for an italic alternative.

Description: ancient Greek oblique font
 From the middle of the 19th century an italic font with many
 calligraphic overtones was introduced into Greek printing. Its source
 is unknown, but it almost certainly was the product of a German or
 Italian foundry. In the first type specimen printed in Greece by the
 typecutter K. Miliadis (1850), the font was listed anonymously along
 others of 11pts and in the Gr. Doumas' undated specimen appeared as
 «11pt Greek inclined». For most of the second half of the century the
 type was used extensively as an italic for emphasis in words,
 sentences or excerpts. In 1889, the folio size Type Specimen of
 Anestis Konstantinidis' publishing, printing and type founding
 establishment also included the type as «Greek inclined [9 & 12 pt]».
 .
 Nevertheless, the excessively calligraphic style of the characters,
 combined with the steep and uncomfortable obliqueness of the
 capitals, was out of favour in the 20th century and the type did not
 survive the conformity of the mechanical type cutting and casting.
 The font has been digitally revived, as part of our typographic
 tradition, by George D.  Matthiopoulos and is part of GFS' type
 library under the name GFS Solomos, in commemoration of the great
 Greek poet of the 19th century, Dionisios Solomos.

Description: OpenType fonts based on Computer Modern
 The Latin Modern fonts, also known as "lm fonts", are a set of
 scalable fonts in PostScript Type 1 and OpenType formats. They are
 based on the PostScript Type 1 version of the Computer Modern fonts
 and contain many additional characters (mostly accented ones).
 .
 This package provides the OpenType variant of these fonts. For support
 for TeX and Type 1 (PostScript) fonts, see the lmodern package.
 .
 The Latin Modern fonts were generated using MetaType1, a program
 based on MetaPost for generating PostScript Type 1 fonts
 (ftp://bop.eps.gda.pl/pub/metatype1/). Their size is reasonable and
 they are usually considered to be of good quality (compared to
 cm-super, for instance; however, cm-super contains font families
 that have no equivalent in this package; additionally, there are
 character sets that are supported by cm-super and not by the Latin
 Modern fonts).

 hand-written look, the Lobster font provides a large number of ligatures,
 as well as terminal forms (i.e. glyphs that are used for word endings).

Description: extended Unicode Latin font ("a typeface for the nations")
 Gentium ("belonging to the nations" in Latin) is a Unicode typeface family
 designed to enable the many diverse ethnic groups around the world who use
 the Latin script to produce readable, high-quality publications. The design
 is intended to be highly readable, reasonably compact, and visually
 attractive. Gentium has won a "Certificate of Excellence in Typeface Design"
 in two major international typeface design competitions: bukva:raz! (2001)
 and TDC2003 (2003).
 .
 Gentium provides glyphs for a wide range of Latin and Greek characters. The
 additional 'extended' Latin letters are designed to naturally harmonize with
 the traditional 26 ones. Diacritics are treated with careful thought and
 attention to their use. Gentium also supports both ancient and modern Greek,
 including a number of alternate forms. It currently supports the following
 ranges of Unicode 3.0 (completely unless noted):
 .
  Range          Description
 .
  U+0020-U+007F  Basic Latin
  U+00A0-U+00FF  Latin-1 Supplement

  U+20A0-U+20CF  Currency Symbols (partial)
  U+2100-U+214F  Letterlike Symbols (only a couple)
 .
 Gentium Regular also includes some Cyrillic glyphs, but they are only early
 drafts. A future version will include a completely revised set, including
 italic, and will expand the support for Latin, Greek and Cyrillic to Unicode
 4.1.
 .
 GentiumAlt is an alternate font with flatter diacritics, specifically
 designed for languages using multiple accents.
 .

 Latin characters, with miscellaneous diacritical marks, symbols and
 punctuation. A much more complete character set will be supported in a future
 version of the complete Gentium fonts. These "Basic" fonts are intended as a
 way to provide additional weights for basic font users without waiting until
 the complete Gentium character set is finished.
 .
 There are, however, some wonderful new features that are still missing from
 the main Gentium family:
  * Bold
  * Bold Italic
  * The slightly-heavier Book family
  * OpenType and Graphite smart code for diacritic placement
  * A few useful OpenType and Graphite features
  * Support for a few more recent additions to Unicode
  * Character assignments updated to Unicode 5.1

Description: extended smart font family for Latin, Greek and Cyrillic
 Gentium ("belonging to the nations" in Latin) is a Unicode typeface family
 designed to enable the many diverse ethnic groups around the world who use the
 Latin script to produce readable, high-quality publications. The design is
 intended to be highly readable, reasonably compact, and visually attractive.
 Gentium has won a "Certificate of Excellence in Typeface Design" in two major
 international typeface design competitions: bukva:raz! (2001) and TDC2003
 (2003). The goal is to provide a single Unicode-based font family that
 contains a comprehensive inventory of glyphs needed for almost any Roman- or
 Cyrillic-based writing system, whether used for phonetic or orthographic
 needs, and provide a matching Greek face. In addition, there is provision for
 other characters and symbols useful to linguists. This font makes use of
 state-of-the-art font technologies to support complex typographic issues, such
 as the need to position arbitrary combinations of base glyphs and diacritics
 optimally.
 .
 Gentium Plus is based on the original Gentium design. However, it now
 has the full OpenType and Graphite support that Doulos SIL and Charis
 SIL contain — including full IPA support.
 .
 Work is ongoing to provide bold and bold-italic weights, as well as a
 complete book-weight family.
 .
 Webfont versions and HTML/CSS examples are also available.
 .
 The full font sources are publicly available at
 https://github.com/silnrsi/font-gentium
 An open workflow is used for building, testing and releasing.

Description: OpenType fonts based on URW Fonts
 The TeX Gyre project, following the Latin Modern project, aims at providing
 a rich collection of diacritical characters in the attempt to cover as many
 Latin-based scripts as possible.
 .
 This package provides the OpenType variant of these fonts. For support
 for TeX and Type 1 (PostScript) fonts, see the tex-gyre package.
 .
 The TeX-GYRE bundle consists of seven font families:
 .
 The TeX Gyre Adventor family of fonts is based on the URW Gothic L
 family (designed by Herb Lubalin and Tom Carnase).
 .
 The TeX Gyre Bonum family of fonts is based on the URW Bookman L family
 (designed by Alexander Phemister).
 .
 The TeX Gyre Chorus font is based on URW Chancery L Medium Italic
 (designed by Hermann Zapf (ITC Zapf Chancery(R), 1979)).
 .
 The TeX Gyre Cursor family is based on the URW Nimbus Mono L family
 (designed by Howard G. (Bud) Kettler in 1955 for the IBM corporation).
 .
 The TeX Gyre Heros family of fonts is based on the URW Nimbus Sans L
 (prepared by Max Miedinger, with Eduard Hoffmann).
 .
 The TeX Gyre Pagella family of fonts is based on the URW Palladio L
 family (designed by Hermann Zapf).
 .
 The TeX Gyre Schola family of fonts is based on the URW Century
 Schoolbook L family (designed by Morris Fuller Benton).
 .
 The TeX Gyre Termes is based on the URW Nimbus Roman No9 L family
 (designed by Stanley Morison together with Starling Burgess and
 Victor Lardent).
 .
 The constituent 4 standard faces of each family have been greatly
 extended, and contain nearly 1200 glyphs each.  Each family is
 available in Adobe Type 1 and Open Type formats, and LaTeX support
 (for use with a variety of encodings) is provided.  Vietnamese
 characters were added by Han The Thanh.

Description: fast, scalable, distributed revision control system
 Git is popular version control system designed to handle very large
 projects with speed and efficiency; it is used for many high profile
 open source projects, most notably the Linux kernel.
 .
 Git falls in the category of distributed source code management tools.
 Every Git working directory is a full-fledged repository with full
 revision tracking capabilities, not dependent on network access or a
 central server.
 .
 This package provides the git main components with minimal dependencies.
 Additional functionality, e.g. a graphical user interface and revision
 tree visualizer, tools for interoperating with other VCS's, or a web
 interface, is provided as separate git* packages.

Description: GNU grep, egrep and fgrep
 'grep' is a utility to search for text in files; it can be used from the
 command line or in scripts.  Even if you don't want to use it, other packages
 on your system probably will.
 .
 The GNU family of grep utilities may be the "fastest grep in the west".
 GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about
 twice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper
 search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being
 considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to
 look at every character. The result is typically many times faster
 than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions containing backreferencing
 will run more slowly, however.)

Description: User space provider drivers for libibverbs
 libibverbs is a library that allows userspace processes to use RDMA
 "verbs" as described in the InfiniBand Architecture Specification and
 the RDMA Protocol Verbs Specification.  iWARP ethernet NICs support
 RDMA over hardware-offloaded TCP/IP, while InfiniBand is a
 high-throughput, low-latency networking technology.  InfiniBand host
 channel adapters (HCAs) and iWARP NICs commonly support direct
 hardware access from userspace (kernel bypass), and libibverbs
 supports this when available.
 .
 A RDMA driver consists of a kernel portion and a user space portion.
 This package contains the user space verbs drivers:

 provide an abstraction for enabling, disabling, starting, and stopping
 services for all supported Debian init systems as specified by the policy.
 .
 While this package is maintained by pkg-systemd-maintainers, it is NOT
 specific to systemd at all. Maintainers of other init systems are welcome to
 include their helpers in this package.

 automatically set their network configuration. If your machine
 depends on DHCP (especially likely if it's a workstation on a large
 network, or a laptop, or attached to a cable modem), keep this or
 another DHCP client installed.

Description: Multi-format archive and compression library (shared library)
 The libarchive library provides a flexible interface for reading and writing
 archives in various formats such as tar and cpio. libarchive also supports
 reading and writing archives compressed using various compression filters such
 as gzip and bzip2. The library is inherently stream-oriented; readers serially
 iterate through the archive, writers serially add things to the archive.
 .
 Archive formats supported are:
 .
    * tar (read and write, including GNU extensions)
    * pax (read and write, including GNU and star extensions)
    * cpio (read and write, including odc and newc variants)
    * iso9660 (read and write, including Joliet and Rockridge extensions, with
      some limitations)
    * zip (read only, with some limitations, uses zlib)
    * mtree (read and write)
    * shar (write only)
    * ar (read and write, including BSD and GNU/SysV variants)
    * empty (read only; in particular, note that no other format will accept an
      empty file)
    * raw (read only)
    * xar (read only)
    * rar (read only, with some limitations)
    * 7zip (read and write, with some limitations)
 .
 Filters supported are:
 .
    * gzip (read and write, uses zlib)
    * bzip2 (read and write, uses bzlib)
    * compress (read and write, uses an internal implementation)
    * uudecode (read only)
    * separate command-line compressors with fixed-signature auto-detection
    * xz and lzma (read and write using liblzma)
    * zstandard (read and write using libzstd)
 .
 This package provides the libarchive shared library.

Description: memory-hard hashing function - runtime library
 Argon2 is a password-hashing function that can be used to hash passwords
 for credential storage, key derivation, or other applications.
 .
 There are two main versions of Argon2: Argon2i and Argon2d.
 Argon2i is the safest against side-channel attacks, while Argon2d provides
 the highest resistance against GPU cracking attacks.
 .
 Argon2i and Argon2d are parametrized by:
  * A time cost, which defines the amount of computation realized and
    therefore the execution time, given in number of iterations
  * A memory cost, which defines the memory usage, given in kibibytes
  * A parallelism degree, which defines the number of parallel threads
 .
 This package includes the dynamic library against which programs are linked.

 Standard Library. One goal is to establish "existing practice" and
 provide reference implementations so that the Boost libraries are
 suitable for eventual standardization. Some of the libraries have
 already been proposed for inclusion in the C++ Standards Committee's
 upcoming C++ Standard Library Technical Report.

Description: C++ representation of time duration, time point, and clocks (default version)
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 The Boost.Chrono library provides:
 .
  * A means to represent time durations: managed by the generic
 duration class . Examples of time durations include days, minutes,
 seconds and nanoseconds, which can be represented with a fixed number
 of clock ticks per unit. All of these units of time duration are
 united with a generic interface by the duration facility.
  * A type for representing points in time: time_point. A time_point
 represents an epoch plus or minus a duration. The library leaves
 epochs unspecified. A time_point is associated with a clock.
  * Several clocks, some of which may not be available on a
 particular platform: system_clock, steady_clock and
 high_resolution_clock. A clock is a pairing of a time_point and
 duration, and a function which returns a time_point representing now.
 .
 To make the timing facilities more generally useful, Boost.Chrono
 provides a number of clocks that are thin wrappers around the
 operating system's time APIs, thereby allowing the extraction of wall
 clock time, user CPU time, system CPU time spent by the process:
 .
  * process_real_cpu_clock, captures wall clock CPU time spent by the
 current process.
  * process_user_cpu_clock, captures user-CPU time
 spent by the current process.
  * process_system_cpu_clock, captures
 system-CPU time spent by the current process.
  * A tuple-like class
 process_cpu_clock, that captures real, user-CPU, and system-CPU
 process times together.
  * A thread_clock thread steady clock giving
 the time spent by the current thread (when supported by a platform).
 .
 Lastly, Boost.Chrono includes typeof registration for duration and
 time_point to permit using emulated auto with C++03 compilers.

  * Containers support stateful allocators and are compatible with
    Boost.Interprocess (they can be safely placed in shared memory).
  * The library offers new useful containers:
    * flat_map, flat_set, flat_multimap and flat_multiset: drop-in
      replacements for standard associative containers but more
      memory friendly and with faster searches.
    * stable_vector: a std::list and std::vector hybrid container:
      vector-like random-access iterators and list-like iterator
      stability in insertions and erasures.
    * slist: the classic pre-standard singly linked list implementation
      offering constant-time size(). Note that C++11 forward_list has no size().

Description: C++ library that implements several well-known containers
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 Boost.Container library implements several well-known containers,
 including STL containers. The aim of the library is to offers
 advanced features not present in standard containers or to offer the
 latest standard draft features for compilers that don't comply with
 the latest C++ standard.
 .
 In short, what does Boost.Container offer?
 .
  * Move semantics are implemented, including move emulation
    for pre-C++11 compilers.
  * New advanced features (e.g. placement insertion,
    recursive containers) are present.
  * Containers support stateful allocators and are compatible with
    Boost.Interprocess (they can be safely placed in shared memory).
  * The library offers new useful containers:
    * flat_map, flat_set, flat_multimap and flat_multiset: drop-in

 Boost.Context is a foundational library that provides a sort of
 cooperative multitasking on a single thread. By providing an
 abstraction of the current execution state in the current thread,
 including the stack (with local variables) and stack pointer, all
 registers and CPU flags, and the instruction pointer, a fcontext_t
 instance represents a specific point in the application's execution
 path. This is useful for building higher-level abstractions, like
 coroutines, cooperative threads (userland threads) or an equivalent
 to C# keyword yield in C++.

 provide reference implementations so that the Boost libraries are
 suitable for eventual standardization. Some of the libraries have
 already been proposed for inclusion in the C++ Standards Committee's
 upcoming C++ Standard Library Technical Report.

Description: cooperatively-scheduled micro-/userland-threads (default version)
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 Boost.Fiber provides a framework for micro-/userland-threads (fibers)
 scheduled cooperatively.  The API contains classes and functions to
 manage and synchronize fibers similarly to standard thread support
 library.
 .
 Each fiber has its own stack.
 .
 A fiber can save the current execution state, including all registers
 and CPU flags, the instruction pointer, and the stack pointer and
 later restore this state. The idea is to have multiple execution
 paths running on a single thread using cooperative scheduling (versus
 threads, which are preemptively scheduled). The running fiber decides
 explicitly when it should yield to allow another fiber to run
 (context switching). Boost.Fiber internally uses execution_context
 from Boost.Context; the classes in this library manage, schedule and,
 when needed, synchronize those execution contexts. A context switch
 between threads usually costs thousands of CPU cycles on x86,
 compared to a fiber switch with less than a hundred cycles. A fiber
 runs on a single thread at any point in time.

Description: generic graph components and algorithms in C++
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 The Parallel Boost Graph Library is an extension to the Boost Graph Library
 (BGL) for parallel and distributed computing. It offers distributed graphs
 and graph algorithms to exploit coarse-grained parallelism along with
 parallel algorithms that exploit fine-grained parallelism, while retaining
 the same interfaces as the (sequential) BGL. Code written using the sequential
 BGL should be easy to parallelize with the parallel BGL.

 Graphs are mathematical abstractions that are useful for solving
 many types of problems in computer science. Consequently, these
 abstractions must also be represented in computer programs. A
 standardized generic interface for traversing graphs is of utmost

 The Boost Python Library is used to quickly and easily export a C++
 library to Python such that the Python interface is very similar to
 the C++ interface. It is designed to be minimally intrusive on your
 C++ design. In most cases, you should not have to alter your C++
 classes in any way in order to use them with Boost.Python.  The
 system should simply "reflect" your C++ classes and functions into
 Python. The major features of Boost.Python include support for:
 Subclassing extension types in Python, Overriding virtual functions
 in Python, Member function Overloading, Automatic wrapping of
 numeric operators among others.

 Regular expressions are a form of pattern-matching that are often

 of which make extensive use of regular expressions. Traditionally C++
 users have been limited to the POSIX C APIs for manipulating regular
 expressions, and while regex does provide these APIs, they do not
 represent the best way to use the library. For example regex can cope
 with wide character strings, or search and replace operations (in a
 manner analogous to either sed or perl), something that traditional C
 libraries can not do.

Description: serialization library for C++
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection,
 containing the following functionalities:
 .
  * proper restoration of pointers to shared data
  * serialization of STL containers and other commonly used templates
  * data portability - streams of bytes created on one platform should
    be readable on any other
  * archive interface must be rich enough to permit the creation of an
    archive that presents serialized data as XML in a useful manner
 .
 Here, "serialization" means the reversible deconstruction of an
 arbitrary set of C++ data structures to a sequence of bytes.
 archive: to refer to a specific rendering of this stream of bytes.

Description: Boost C++ Libraries development files
 The Boost web site provides free, peer-reviewed, portable C++ source
 libraries. The emphasis is on libraries which work well with the C++
 Standard Library. One goal is to establish "existing practice" and
 provide reference implementations so that the Boost libraries are
 suitable for eventual standardization. Some of the libraries have
 already been proposed for inclusion in the C++ Standards Committee's
 upcoming C++ Standard Library Technical Report.
 .
 This package provides headers for all Boost libraries.
 .
 Extended precision arithmetic package libmpfrc++-dev or libntl-dev is
 required to use the Boost.Multiprecision wrapping of the respective
 library.

 Brotli is a generic-purpose lossless compression algorithm
 that compresses data using a combination of a modern variant
 of the LZ77 algorithm, Huffman coding and 2nd order context modeling,
 with a compression ratio comparable to the best currently available
 general-purpose compression methods. It is similar in speed with
 deflate but offers more dense compression.

Description: Bauer stereophonic-to-binaural DSP library
 The Bauer stereophonic-to-binaural DSP (bs2b) is designed to improve
 headphone listening of stereo audio records.
 .
 Typical stereo recordings are made for listening with speakers.
 What's missing in headphones is the sound going from each channel
 to the opposite ear, arriving a short time later for the extra distance
 traveled, and with a bit of high frequency roll-off for the shadowing
 effect of the head. The time delay to the far ear should also be
 somewhat longer at low frequencies than at high frequencies. bs2b
 implements both of these ideas to transform stereophonic recordings
 for headphone listening.

Description: high-quality block-sorting file compressor library - runtime
 This package contains libbzip2 which is used by the bzip2 compressor.
 .
 bzip2 is a freely available, patent free, data compressor.
 .
 bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text
 compression algorithm, and Huffman coding.  Compression is generally
 considerably better than that achieved by more conventional
 LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM
 family of statistical compressors.
 .
 The archive file format of bzip2 (.bz2) is incompatible with that of its
 predecessor, bzip (.bz).

Description: Cairo 2D vector graphics library
 Cairo is a multi-platform library providing anti-aliased
 vector-based rendering for multiple target backends. Paths consist
 of line segments and cubic splines and can be rendered at any width
 with various join and cap styles. All colors may be specified with
 optional translucence (opacity/alpha) and combined using the
 extended Porter/Duff compositing algebra as found in the X Render
 Extension.
 .
 Cairo exports a stateful rendering API similar in spirit to the path
 construction, text, and painting operators of PostScript, (with the
 significant addition of translucence in the imaging model). When
 complete, the API is intended to support the complete imaging model of
 PDF 1.4.

Description: routines to convert IEEE floats to and from strings
 This library provides routines to convert IEEE single and double floats to and
 from string representations. It offers at lot of flexibility with respect to
 the conversion format: shortest, fixed, precision or exponential
 representation; decimal, octal or hexadecimal basis; control over number of
 digits, leading/trailing zeros and spaces.
 .
 The library consists of efficient conversion routines that have been
 extracted from the V8 JavaScript engine. The code has been refactored
 and improved so that it can be used more easily in other projects.
 .
 This package contains a shared version of the library.

Description: utility to determine the locale encoding
 In many applications it's wise to let Perl use Unicode for the strings it
 processes. Most of the interfaces Perl has to the outside world are still byte
 based. Programs therefore need to decode byte strings that enter the program
 from the outside and encode them again on the way out.
 .
 The POSIX locale system is used to specify both the language conventions
 requested by the user and the preferred character set to consume and output.
 The Encode::Locale module looks up the charset and encoding (called a CODESET
 in the locale jargon) and arranges for the Encode module to know this encoding
 under the name "locale". It means bytes obtained from the environment can be
 converted to Unicode strings by calling Encode::encode(locale => $bytes) and
 converted back again with Encode::decode(locale => $string).

Description: Perl module for error/exception handling in an OO-ish way
 The Error module provides two interfaces.  Firstly "Error" provides a
 procedural interface to exception handling. Secondly "Error" is a base class
 for errors/exceptions that can either be thrown, for subsequent catch, or can
 simply be recorded.
 .
 Errors in the class "Error" should not be thrown directly, but the user
 should throw errors from a sub-class of "Error".
 .
 Warning: Using the "Error" module is no longer recommended due to the
 black-magical nature of its syntactic sugar, which often tends to break. Its
 maintainers have stopped actively writing code that uses it, and discourage
 people from doing so.
 .
 Recommended alternatives are Exception::Class (libexception-class-perl),
 Error::Exception (not packaged), TryCatch (libtrycatch-perl), and Try::Tiny
 (libtry-tiny-perl).

Description: Asynchronous event notification library (openssl)
 Libevent is an asynchronous event notification library that provides a
 mechanism to execute a callback function when a specific event occurs
 on a file descriptor or after a timeout has been reached.
 .
 It is meant to replace the asynchronous event loop found in
 event driven network servers. Currently, libevent supports /dev/poll,
 kqueue(2), event ports, select(2), poll(2) and epoll(4).
 .
 There is now a bufferevent type that supports SSL/TLS using the
 OpenSSL library.  The code for this is build in a separate
 library, libevent_openssl, so that your programs don't need to
 link against OpenSSL unless they actually want SSL support.

Description: conservative garbage collector for C and C++
 Boehm-Demers-Weiser's GC is a garbage collecting storage allocator that is
 intended to be used as a plug-in replacement for C's malloc or C++'s new().
 .
 It allows you to allocate memory basically as you normally would without
 explicitly deallocating memory that is no longer useful. The collector
 automatically recycles memory when it determines that it can no longer be
 used.
 .
 This version of the collector is thread safe, has C++ support and uses the
 defaults for everything else. However, it does not work as a drop-in malloc(3)
 replacement.

Description: Font rendering engine for Complex Scripts -- library
 Graphite is a system that can be used to create and use "smart fonts" capable
 of displaying writing systems with various complex behaviors, such as:
 contextual shaping, ligatures, reordering, split glyphs, bidirectionality,
 stacking diacritics and complex positioning.
 .
 This library was designed and developed by the NRSI (Non-Roman Script
 Initiative) within SIL International (www.sil.org) to act as a complement to
 other smart font rendering technologies with limited practical local
 extensibility. Its purpose is to help meet the needs of a very large number
 of "minority language" communities for local extensibility of complex script
 behaviors.
 .
 The behavior of the rendering engine for a given writing system is specified
 through extra tables added to a TrueType font.  These tables are generated by
 compiling a GDL (Graphite Description Language) source file into a font using
 grcompiler.
 .
 This package contains the shared library.

Description: Shared libraries for GSM speech compressor
 This package contains runtime shared libraries for libgsm, an
 implementation of the European GSM 06.10 provisional standard for
 full-rate speech transcoding, prI-ETS 300 036, which uses RPE/LTP
 (residual pulse excitation/long term prediction) coding at 13 kbit/s.
 .
 GSM 06.10 compresses frames of 160 13-bit samples (8 kHz sampling
 rate, i.e. a frame rate of 50 Hz) into 260 bits; for compatibility
 with typical UNIX applications, this implementation turns frames of
 160 16-bit linear samples into 33-byte frames (1650 Bytes/s).
 The quality of the algorithm is good enough for reliable speaker
 recognition; even music often survives transcoding in recognizable

 .
 The interfaces offered are a front end modelled after compress(1), and
 a library API.  Compression and decompression run faster than realtime
 on most SPARCstations.  The implementation has been verified against the
 ETSI standard test patterns.

Description: low level cryptographic library (public-key cryptos)
 Nettle is a cryptographic library that is designed to fit easily in more or
 less any context: In crypto toolkits for object-oriented languages (C++,
 Python, Pike, ...), in applications like LSH or GNUPG, or even in kernel
 space.
 .
 It tries to solve a problem of providing a common set of cryptographic
 algorithms for higher-level applications by implementing a
 context-independent set of cryptographic algorithms. In that light, Nettle
 doesn't do any memory allocation or I/O, it simply provides the
 cryptographic algorithms for the application to use in any environment and
 in any way it needs.
 .
 This package contains the asymmetric cryptographic algorithms, which,
 require the GNU multiple precision arithmetic library (libgmp) for
 their large integer computations.

Description: HTTP cookie jars
 This class is for objects that represent a "cookie jar" -- that is, a

 about.
 .
 Cookies are a general mechanism which server side connections can use to both
 store and retrieve information on the client side of the connection. For more
 information about cookies refer to
 <URL:http://curl.haxx.se/rfc/cookie_spec.html> and
 <URL:http://www.cookiecentral.com/>. HTTP::Cookies also implements the new
 style cookies described in RFC 2965. The two variants of cookies are supposed
 to be able to coexist happily.
 .
 Instances of the class HTTP::Cookies are able to store a collection of
 Set-Cookie2: and Set-Cookie: headers and are able to use this information to
 initialize Cookie-headers in HTTP::Request objects. The state of a
 HTTP::Cookies object can be saved in and restored from files.

 Instances of the HTTP::Daemon class are HTTP/1.1 servers that listen on a

 IO::Socket::IP, so you can perform socket operations directly on it too.
 .
 The accept() method will return when a connection from a client is available.
 The returned value will be an HTTP::Daemon::ClientConn object which is
 another IO::Socket::IP subclass. Calling the get_request() method on this
 object will read data from the client and return an HTTP::Request object. The

Description: perl interface to HTTP style messages
 The HTTP::Message distribution contains classes useful for representing the
 messages passed in HTTP style communication. These are classes representing
 requests, responses and the headers contained within them.
 .
 The HTTP::Headers class encapsulates HTTP-style message headers. The headers
 consist of attribute-value pairs also called fields, which may be repeated,
 and which are printed in a particular order. The field names are cases
 insensitive.
 .
 Instances of this class are usually created as member variables of the
 HTTP::Request and HTTP::Response classes, internal to the library.

Description: HTTPS driver for LWP::UserAgent
 The LWP::Protocol::https module provides support for using HTTPS schemed URLs
 with LWP. LWP::Protocol::https is a plug-in to the LWP protocol handling, so
 you don't use it directly. Once the module is installed LWP is able to access
 sites using HTTP over SSL/TLS.
 .
 If hostname verification is requested by LWP::UserAgent's ssl_opts, and
 neither SSL_ca_file nor SSL_ca_path is set, then SSL_ca_file is implied to be
 the one provided by ca-certificates.
 .
 This module used to be bundled with libwww-perl, but it was unbundled in
 v6.02 in order to be able to declare its dependencies properly for the CPAN
 tool-chain. Applications that need HTTPS support can just declare their
 dependency on LWP::Protocol::https and will no longer need to know what
 underlying modules to install.

Description: minimalistic Netlink communication library
 libmnl is a minimalistic user-space library oriented to Netlink developers.
 There are a lot of common tasks in parsing, validating, constructing of
 both the Netlink header and TLVs that are repetitive and easy to get wrong.
 This library aims to provide simple helpers that allows you to re-use code
 and to avoid re-inventing the wheel.
 .
 The main features of this library are:
 .
 Small: the shared library requires around 30KB for an x86-based computer.
 .
 Simple: this library avoids complexity and elaborated abstractions that
 tend to hide Netlink details.
 .
 Easy to use: the library simplifies the work for Netlink-wise developers.
 It provides functions to make socket handling, message building,
 validating, parsing and sequence tracking, easier.
 .
 Easy to re-use: you can use the library to build your own abstraction
 layer on top of this library.
 .
 Decoupling: the interdependency of the main bricks that compose the
 library is reduced, i.e. the library provides many helpers, but the
 programmer is not forced to use them.
 .
 This package contains the shared libraries needed to run programs that use
 the minimalistic Netlink communication library.

 future versions will be smart like that. Port 465 is usually what you want,

 Nettle is a cryptographic library that is designed to fit easily in more or
 less any context: In crypto toolkits for object-oriented languages (C++,
 Python, Pike, ...), in applications like LSH or GNUPG, or even in kernel
 space.
 .
 It tries to solve a problem of providing a common set of cryptographic
 algorithms for higher-level applications by implementing a
 context-independent set of cryptographic algorithms. In that light, Nettle
 doesn't do any memory allocation or I/O, it simply provides the
 cryptographic algorithms for the application to use in any environment and
 in any way it needs.
 .
 This package contains the symmetric and one-way cryptographic
 algorithms. To avoid having this package depend on libgmp, the
 asymmetric cryptos reside in a separate library, libhogweed.

Description: OpenPGM shared library
 OpenPGM is an open source implementation of the Pragmatic General Multicast
 (PGM) specification in RFC 3208 available at www.ietf.org. PGM is a reliable
 and scalable multicast protocol that enables receivers to detect loss,
 request retransmission of lost data, or notify an application of
 unrecoverable loss. PGM is a receiver-reliable protocol, which means the
 receiver is responsible for ensuring all data is received, absolving the
 sender of reception responsibility. PGM runs over a best effort datagram
 service, currently OpenPGM uses IP multicast but could be implemented above
 switched fabrics such as InfiniBand.
 .
 This is the runtime package for programs that use the OpenPGM library.

 use special generated source code to easily write and read your structured
 data to and from a variety of data streams and using a variety of languages.
 You can even update your data structure without breaking deployed programs
 that are compiled against the "old" format.

 Google uses Protocol Buffers for almost all of its internal RPC protocols and
 file formats.

 use special generated source code to easily write and read your structured
 data to and from a variety of data streams and using a variety of languages.
 You can even update your data structure without breaking deployed programs
 that are compiled against the "old" format.

Version: 0.4-1
Description: pthread stubs not provided by native libc, development files
 This library provides weak aliases for pthread functions not provided
 in libc or otherwise available by default.  Libraries like libxcb rely
 on pthread stubs to use pthreads optionally, becoming thread-safe when
 linked to libpthread, while avoiding any performance hit when running
 single-threaded. libpthread-stubs supports this behavior even on
 platforms which do not supply all the necessary pthread stubs.
 .
 On platforms which already supply all the necessary pthread stubs, this
 package ships only the pkg-config file pthread-stubs.pc, to allow
 libraries to unconditionally express a dependency on pthread-stubs and
 still obtain correct behavior.

Description: Audio sample rate conversion library
 libsamplerate (aka Secret Rabbit Code) is a library for audio rate conversion.
 .
 libsamplerate currently provides three different sample rate conversion
 algorithms; zero order hold, linear interpolation and FIR filter interpolation
 (using filters derived from the mathematical SINC function). The first two
 algorithms (zero order hold and linear) are included for completeness and are
 not recommended for any application where high quality sample rate conversion
 is required. For the FIR/Sinc algorithm, three converters are provided;
 SRC_SINC_FASTEST, SRC_SINC_MEDIUM_QUALITY and SRC_SINC_BEST_QUALITY to allow a
 trade off between conversion speed and conversion quality.
 .
 libsamplerate is capable of downsampling to 1/256 of the original sample rate
 and upsampling to 256 times the original sample rate. It is also capable of
 time varying conversions for vary speed effects and synchronising of two
 unlocked sample rates.

 This package provides the shared libraries for Security-enhanced
 Linux that provides interfaces (e.g. library functions for the
 SELinux kernel APIs like getcon(), other support functions like
 getseuserbyname()) to SELinux-aware applications. Security-enhanced
 Linux is a patch of the Linux kernel and a number of utilities with
 enhanced security functionality designed to add mandatory access
 controls to Linux.  The Security-enhanced Linux kernel contains new
 architectural components originally developed to improve the security
 of the Flask operating system. These architectural components provide
 general support for the enforcement of many kinds of mandatory access
 control policies, including those based on the concepts of Type
 Enforcement, Role-based Access Control, and Multi-level Security.
 .
 libselinux1 provides an API for SELinux applications to get and set
 process and file security contexts and to obtain security policy
 decisions.  Required for any applications that use the SELinux
 API. libselinux may use the shared libsepol to manipulate the binary
 policy if necessary (e.g. to downgrade the policy format to an older
 version supported by the kernel) when loading policy.

Description: lightweight RDF syntax library
 Serd is a lightweight C library for RDF syntax which supports reading
 and writing Turtle and NTriples.
 .
 Serd is not intended to be a swiss-army knife of RDF syntax, but rather
 is suited to resource limited applications, or situations where a simple
 reader/writer with minimal dependencies is ideal (e.g. in LV2 hosts or
 plugins).
 .
 Serd is:
  * small: Serd is implemented in under 2500 lines1 of standard C code.
  * portable and dependency-free: Serd uses only the C standard library,
    and has no external dependencies, making it a lightweight dependency
    in every sense.
  * fast and lightweight: Serd (and the included serdi tool) can be used
    to stream abbreviated Turtle (unlike many other tools which can not
    stream since they must first build an internal model to abbreviate).
    In other words, Serd can re-serialise an unbounded amount of Turtle
    using a fixed amount of memory, preserving the abbreviations in the
    input.
  * conformant and well-tested: Serd is written to the Turtle, NTriples
    and URI specifications, and includes a comprehensive test suite which
    includes all the normative examples from the Turtle specification, all
    the "normal" examples from the URI specification, and additional tests
    added specifically for Serd. The test suite has over 96% code coverage
    (by line), and runs with zero memory errors or leaks.

Description: FFmpeg library for audio resampling, rematrixing etc. - runtime files
 FFmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode, transcode,
 mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything that humans and
 machines have created. It supports the most obscure ancient formats up to the
 cutting edge.
 .
 This library provides performs highly optimized audio resampling, rematrixing
 and sample format conversion operations.
 Specifically, this library performs the following conversions:
  * Resampling is the process of changing the audio rate, for example from a
    high sample rate of 44100Hz to 8000Hz. Audio conversion from high to low
    sample rate is a lossy process. Several resampling options and algorithms
    are available.
  * Rematrixing is the process of changing the channel layout, for example from
    stereo to mono. When the input channels cannot be mapped to the output
    streams, the process is lossy, since it involves different gain factors
    and mixing. Various other audio conversions (e.g. stretching and padding)
    are enabled through dedicated options.
  * Format conversion is the process of converting the type of samples, for
    example from 16-bit signed samples to unsigned 8-bit or float samples.
    It also handles packing conversion, when passing from packed layout (all
    samples belonging to distinct channels interleaved in the same buffer), to
    planar layout (all samples belonging to the same channel stored in a
    dedicated buffer or "plane").
 .
 This package contains the runtime files.

 .
 This library performs highly optimized image scaling and colorspace and pixel
 format conversion operations.
 Specifically, this library performs the following conversions:
  * Rescaling is the process of changing the video size. Several rescaling

  * Pixel format conversion is the process of converting the image format and
    colorspace of the image, for example from planar YUV420P to RGB24 packed.
    It also handles packing conversion, that is converts from packed layout
    (all pixels belonging to distinct planes interleaved in the same buffer),
    to planar layout (all samples belonging to the same plane stored in a
    dedicated buffer or "plane"). This is usually a lossy process in case the
    source and destination colorspaces differ.

Description: Generic library support script
 This is GNU libtool, a generic library support script.  Libtool hides
 the complexity of generating special library types (such as shared
 libraries) behind a consistent interface.  To use libtool, add the
 new generic library building commands to your Makefile, Makefile.in,
 or Makefile.am.  See the documentation for details.  Libtool supports
 building static libraries on all platforms.
 .
 Libtool supports generation of C, C++, Fortran and Java libraries.

Description: library for forensics analysis on volume and filesystem data
 The Sleuth Kit, also known as TSK, is a collection of UNIX-based command
 line file and volume system forensic analysis tools. The filesystem tools
 allow you to examine filesystems of a suspect computer in a non-intrusive
 fashion. Because the tools do not rely on the operating system to process the
 filesystems, deleted and hidden content is shown.
 .
 The volume system (media management) tools allow you to examine the layout of
 disks and other media. You can also recover deleted files, get information
 stored in slack spaces, examine filesystems journal, see partitions layout on
 disks or images etc. But is very important clarify that the TSK acts over the
 current filesystem only.
 .
 The Sleuth Kit supports DOS partitions, BSD partitions (disk labels), Mac
 partitions, Sun slices (Volume Table of Contents), and GPT disks. With these
 tools, you can identify where partitions are located and extract them so that
 they can be analyzed with filesystem analysis tools.
 .
 Currently, TSK supports several filesystems, as NTFS, FAT, exFAT, HFS+, Ext3,
 Ext4, UFS and YAFFS2.
 .
 This package contains the library which can be used to implement all of the
 functionality of the command line tools into an application that needs to
 analyze data from a disk image.

 TwoLAME does NOT support MPEG Audio Layer 3 (MP3) encoding due to patent
 issues surrounding MP3.

 However, as most MPEG Audio players are able to play layer 2 (MP2) files,
 TwoLAME makes a very good drop-in replacement for LAME and other layer 3
 encoders.

  * files watchers and asynchronous operations
  * a portable TCP and UDP API, as well as asynchronous DNS resolution
  * processes and threads management, and a portable inter-process
    communications mechanism, with pipes and work queues
  * a plugins mechanism for loading libraries dynamically
  * interface with external libraries that also need to access the I/O.

Description: audio visualization framework
 Libvisual is a generic visualization framework that allows applications

 .
 Audio visualization is the process of making pretty moving images that

 player, making it difficult to share code. Libvisual allows applications
 to use existing visualization plugins written for the libvisual framework.
 .

 Xcursor is a simple library designed to help locate and load cursors for the
 X Window System.  Cursors can be loaded from files or memory and can exist in
 several sizes; the library automatically picks the best size.  When using
 images loaded from files, Xcursor prefers to use the Render extension's
 CreateCursor request for rendering cursors.  Where the Render extension is
 not supported, Xcursor maps the cursor image to a standard X cursor and uses
 the core X protocol CreateCursor request.
 .
 Preferred themes for cursors can be installed if desired, via
 xcursor-themes or other cursor-theme or icon-theme packages,
 configured with update-alternatives --config x-cursor-theme.

Description: Perl module for parsing XML files
 The XML::Parser module provides ways to parse XML documents.  It is built on
 top of XML::Parser::Expat, which is a lower level interface to James Clark's
 expat library. Each call to one of the parsing methods creates a new instance
 of XML::Parser::Expat which is then used to parse the document. Expat options
 may be provided when the XML::Parser object is created. These options are
 then passed on to the Expat object on each parse call. They can also be given
 as extra arguments to the parse methods, in which case they override options
 given at XML::Parser creation time.
 .
 The behavior of the parser is controlled either by Style and/or Handlers
 options, or by setHandlers method. These all provide mechanisms for
 XML::Parser to set the handlers needed by XML::Parser::Expat. If neither
 Style nor Handlers are specified, then parsing just checks the document for
 being well-formed.
 .
 When underlying handlers get called, they receive as their first parameter
 the Expat object, not the Parser object.

Description: Perl module for processing huge XML documents in tree mode
 The XML::Twig module provides a way to process XML documents.  It is built on
 top of XML::Parser.
 .
 The module offers a tree interface to the document, while allowing to
 output the parts of it that have been completely processed.
 .
 It allows minimal resource (CPU and memory) usage by building the
 tree only for the parts of the documents that need actual processing,
 through the use of the twig_roots and twig_print_outside_roots
 options.  The finish and finish_print methods also help to increase
 performance.
 .
 XML::Twig tries to make simple things easy so it tries its best to
 takes care of a lot of the (usually) annoying (but sometimes
 necessary) features that come with XML and XML::Parser.

Description: re-usable XPath engine for DOM-like trees
 XML::XPathEngine provides an XPath engine, that can be re-used by other
 module/classes that implement trees.
 .
 In order to use the XPath engine, nodes in the user module need to mimic
 DOM nodes. The degree of similarity between the user tree and a DOM dictates
 how much of the XPath features can be used. A module implementing all of the
 DOM should be able to use this module very easily (you might need to add
 the cmp method on nodes in order to get ordered result sets).
 .
 This module is derived from Matt Sergeant's XML::XPath.

Description: Vertical Blanking Interval decoder (VBI) - common files
 The vertical blanking interval (VBI) is an interval in a television signal
 that temporarily suspends transmission of the signal for the electron gun
 to move back up to the first line of the television screen to trace the
 next screen field.
 .
 The vertical blanking interval can be used to carry data, since anything
 sent during the VBI would naturally not be displayed; various test signals,
 closed captioning, and other digital data can be sent during this time
 period. These include information like closed-caption data, Teletext
 (primarily in Europe), and now Intercast and the ATVEC Internet television
 encodings.
 .
 The Zapping VBI library, in short ZVBI, provides functions to capture and
 decode VBI data. It is written in plain ANSI C with few dependencies on
 other tools and libraries, licensed under GPL. Some features:
   * Captures raw VBI samples from V4L, V4L2 and FreeBSD BKTR devices, sliced
     VBI data from Linux DVB devices;
   * Implements a VBI Proxy to share one VBI device between multiple
     applications;
   * Has a robust and versatile bit slicer which handles a wide range of data
     services;
   * Functions to capture multiple data services at once, such as Closed
     Caption (both NTSC and PAL), Teletext, VPS, WSS, XDS;
   * Level 3.5 Teletext decoder with support for all Teletext character sets,
     graphics, 4096 colors, with built-in page cache including search
     functions;
   * Closed Caption decoder which supports roll-up, pop-up and paint-on style
     caption, color, expanded character set, text attributes and free text
     placement;
   * Renders Teletext and Caption pages, can export to HTML, PNG and other
     formats.
   * Can determine network names;
   * Can find Teletext subtitle and program pages;
   * Functions to extract data transmissions in Teletext streams (currently
     Page Format Clear and Independent Data Line Format A);
   * Can multiplex and demultiplex DVB VBI PES and TS streams.

Description: Modular compiler and toolchain technologies
 LLVM is a collection of libraries and tools that make it easy to build
 compilers, optimizers, just-in-time code generators, and many other
 compiler-related programs.
 .
 LLVM uses a single, language-independent virtual instruction set both
 as an offline code representation (to communicate code between
 compiler phases and to run-time systems) and as the compiler internal
 representation (to analyze and transform programs). This persistent
 code representation allows a common set of sophisticated compiler
 techniques to be applied at compile-time, link-time, install-time,
 run-time, or "idle-time" (between program runs).
 .
 The strengths of the LLVM infrastructure are its extremely
 simple design (which makes it easy to understand and use),
 source-language independence, powerful mid-level optimizer, automated
 compiler debugging support, extensibility, and its stability and
 reliability. LLVM is currently being used to host a wide variety of
 academic research projects and commercial projects. LLVM includes C
 and C++ front-ends, a front-end for a Forth-like language (Stacker),
 a young scheme front-end, and Java support is in development. LLVM can
 generate code for X96, SparcV10, PowerPC or many other architectures.

Description: macro processing language
 GNU `m4' is an implementation of the traditional UNIX macro
 processor.  It is mostly SVR4 compatible, although it has some
 extensions (for example, handling more than 9 positional parameters to
 macros).  `m4' also has builtin functions for including files, running
 shell commands, doing arithmetic, etc.  Autoconf needs GNU `m4' for
 generating `configure' scripts, but not for running them.

Description: utility for directing compilation
 GNU Make is a utility which controls the generation of executables
 and other target files of a program from the program's source
 files. It determines automatically which pieces of a large program
 need to be (re)created, and issues the commands to (re)create
 them. Make can be used to organize any task in which targets (files)
 are to be automatically updated based on input files whenever the
 corresponding input is newer --- it is not limited to building
 computer programs. Indeed, Make is a general purpose dependency
 solver.

Depends: libc6 (>= 2.29)
Description: Pattern scanning and text processing language
 Mawk is an interpreter for the AWK Programming Language. The AWK
 language is useful for manipulation of data files, text retrieval and
 processing, and for prototyping and experimenting with algorithms. Mawk
 is a new awk meaning it implements the AWK language as defined in Aho,
 Kernighan and Weinberger, The AWK Programming Language, Addison-Wesley
 Publishing, 1988. (Hereafter referred to as the AWK book.) Mawk conforms
 to the POSIX 1003.2 (draft 11.3) definition of the AWK language
 which contains a few features not described in the AWK book, and mawk
 provides a small number of extensions.
 .
 Mawk is smaller and much faster than gawk. It has some compile-time
 limits such as NF = 32767 and sprintf buffer = 1020.

Description: small build system closest in spirit to Make
 Ninja is yet another build system. It takes as input the interdependencies of
 files (typically source code and output executables) and orchestrates
 building them, quickly.
 .
 Ninja joins a sea of other build systems. Its distinguishing goal is to be
 fast. It is born from the Chromium browser project, which has over 30,000
 source files and whose other build systems can take ten seconds to start
 building after changing one file. Ninja is under a second.

Description: ML language implementation with a class-based object system
 Objective Caml (OCaml) is an implementation of the ML language, based on
 the Caml Light dialect extended with a complete class-based object system
 and a powerful module system in the style of Standard ML.
 .
 OCaml comprises two compilers. One generates bytecode
 which is then interpreted by a C program. This compiler runs quickly,
 generates compact code with moderate memory requirements, and is
 portable to essentially any 32 or 64 bit Unix platform. Performance of
 generated programs is quite good for a bytecoded implementation:
 almost twice as fast as Caml Light 0.7. This compiler can be used
 either as a standalone, batch-oriented compiler that produces
 standalone programs, or as an interactive, toplevel-based system.
 .
 The other compiler generates high-performance native code for a number
 of processors. Compilation takes longer and generates bigger code, but
 the generated programs deliver excellent performance, while retaining
 the moderate memory requirements of the bytecode compiler. It is not
 available on all arches though.
 .
 This package contains everything needed to develop OCaml applications,
 including the graphics libraries.

 .
 Ssh (Secure Shell) is a program for logging into a remote machine
 and for executing commands on a remote machine.
 It provides secure encrypted communications between two untrusted
 hosts over an insecure network. X11 connections and arbitrary TCP/IP
 ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.
 It can be used to provide applications with a secure communication
 channel.
 .
 This package provides the ssh, scp and sftp clients, the ssh-agent

 and the ssh-keygen, ssh-keyscan, ssh-copy-id and ssh-argv0 utilities.
 .
 In some countries it may be illegal to use any encryption at all
 without a special permit.
 .
 ssh replaces the insecure rsh, rcp and rlogin programs, which are
 obsolete for most purposes.

Description: Larry Wall's Practical Extraction and Report Language
 Perl is a highly capable, feature-rich programming language with over
 20 years of development. Perl 5 runs on over 100 platforms from
 portables to mainframes. Perl is suitable for both rapid prototyping
 and large scale development projects.
 .
 Perl 5 supports many programming styles, including procedural,
 functional, and object-oriented. In addition to this, it is supported
 by an ever-growing collection of reusable modules which accelerate
 development. Some of these modules include Web frameworks, database
 integration, networking protocols, and encryption. Perl provides
 interfaces to C and C++ for custom extension development.

Description: Core Perl modules
 Architecture independent Perl modules.  These modules are part of Perl and
 required if the `perl' package is installed.
 .
 Note that this package only exists to save archive space and should be
 considered an internal implementation detail of the `perl' package.
 Other packages should not depend on `perl-modules-5.30' directly, they
 should use `perl' (which depends on `perl-modules-5.30') instead.

Description: version compatibility baseline for Perl OpenSSL packages
 A subset of Perl XS module packages expose the OpenSSL binary interface
 to Perl code. This can lead to incompatibilities if these packages are
 linked against different versions of OpenSSL.
 .
 This package provides a virtual package "perl-openssl-abi-x" that
 corresponds to the libssl-dev package SONAME it was built against.
 The packages that need to stay compatible with each other can depend
 on this.
 .
 Tools are also provided for generating this dependency with minimum
 hassle. See the instructions in README.Debian.

Description: curses-based PIN or pass-phrase entry dialog for GnuPG
 This package contains a program that allows for secure entry of PINs or
 pass phrases.  That means it tries to take care that the entered
 information is not swapped to disk or temporarily stored anywhere.
 This functionality is particularly useful for entering pass phrases
 when using encryption software such as GnuPG or e-mail clients using
 the same.  It uses an open protocol and is therefore not tied to
 particular software.
 .
 The program contained in this package implements a PIN entry dialog
 using the curses tool kit, meaning that it is useful for users
 working in text mode without the X Window System.  There are sibling
 packages that implement PIN entry dialogs that use an X tool kit.  If
 you install any of the graphical packages then this package is not
 necessary because the sibling packages automatically fall back to
 text mode if X is not active.

Description: extraction of elements from LaTeX documents as graphics
 The purpose of preview is the extraction of selected elements from a
 LaTeX source, like formulas or graphics, into separate pages of a DVI
 file.  A flexible and convenient interface allows it to specify what
 commands and constructs should be extracted.  This works with DVI files
 postprocessed by either Dvips and Ghostscript or dvipng, but it also
 works when using PDFTeX for generating PDF files.
 .
 Currently, preview.sty is used by preview-latex, the WYSIWYG component of
 the AUCTeX editing environment; for generation of previews in LyX; as
 part of the operation of the ps4pdf and pst-pdf LaTeX packages; by the
 tbook XML system and some other tools.

Description: compiler for protocol buffer definition files
 Protocol buffers are a flexible, efficient, automated mechanism for
 serializing structured data - similar to XML, but smaller, faster, and
 simpler. You define how you want your data to be structured once, then you can
 use special generated source code to easily write and read your structured
 data to and from a variety of data streams and using a variety of languages.
 You can even update your data structure without breaking deployed programs
 that are compiled against the "old" format.
 .
 Google uses Protocol Buffers for almost all of its internal RPC protocols and
 file formats.
 .
 This package contains the protocol buffer compiler that is used for
 translating from .proto files (containing the definitions) to the language
 binding for the supported languages.

Description: convert PostScript to EPS (Encapsulated PostScript) files
 ps2eps is a tool to produce Encapsulated PostScript Files (EPS/EPSF)
 from usual one-paged Postscript documents. It calculates correct
 Bounding Boxes for those EPS files and filters some special
 postscript command sequences that can produce erroneous results on
 printers.  EPS files are needed for including (scalable) graphics
 into TeX (or even Word) documents.  Other programs like ps2epsi do
 not calculate the bounding box always correctly (because the values are
 put on the PostScript stack which may get corrupted by bad PostScript
 code) or rounded it off so that clipping the EPS cut off some parts of
 the image. Therefore ps2eps uses a resolution of 144 DPI to get the
 correct bounding box.

Description: simplify usage of Python decorators by programmers
 Python 2.4 decorators have significantly changed the way Python programs are
 structured.
    * decorators help reduce boilerplate code;
    * decorators help the separation of concerns;
    * decorators enhance readability and maintainability;
    * decorators are very explicit.
 Still, as of now, writing custom decorators correctly requires some
 experience and is not as easy as it could be. For instance, typical
 implementations of decorators involve nested functions and we all know that
 flat is better than nested.
 The aim of the decorator module it to simplify the usage of decorators for
 the average programmer and to popularize decorators usage giving examples of
 useful decorators, such as memoize, tracing, redirecting_stdout, locked, etc.

Description: ruby make-like utility
 Rake is a simple ruby build program with capabilities similar to make.

 Rake has the following features:
   * Rakefiles (rakes version of Makefiles) are completely defined in
     standard Ruby syntax. No XML files to edit. No quirky Makefile
     syntax to worry about (is that a tab or a space?)
   * Users can specify tasks with prerequisites.
   * Rake supports rule patterns to sythesize implicit tasks.
   * Rake is lightweight. It can be distributed with other
     projects as a single file. Projects that depend upon
     rake do not require that rake be installed on target
     systems.

Description: hardware information-gathering tool for VESA PnP monitors
 read-edid consists of two tools:
 .
 get-edid uses a VESA VBE 2 interrupt service routine request to read
 a 128 byte EDID version 1 structure from your graphics card, which
 retrieves this information from the monitor via the Data Display
 Channel (DDC).
 .
 get-edid uses architecture-specific methods for querying the video
 hardware (real-mode x86 instructions on i386, Open Firmware device
 tree parsing on PowerMac) and is therefore only available for i386 and
 powerpc architectures.
 .
 parse-edid parses this data structure and outputs data suitable for
 inclusion into the XFree86 or X.org configuration file. It is available
 for any architecture.

 algorithms in a repeatable manner. Now you can assert that your newb
 co-worker doesn't replace your linear algorithm with an exponential
 one!
 .
 minitest/mock by Steven Baker, is a beautifully tiny mock object
 framework.
 .
 minitest/pride shows pride in testing and adds coloring to your test
 output.
 .
 minitest/unit is meant to have a clean implementation for language
 implementors that need a minimal set of methods to bootstrap a working
 test suite. For example, there is no magic involved for test-case
 discovery.

Description: tools for forensics analysis on volume and filesystem data
 The Sleuth Kit, also known as TSK, is a collection of UNIX-based command
 line file and volume system forensic analysis tools. The filesystem tools
 allow you to examine filesystems of a suspect computer in a non-intrusive
 fashion. Because the tools do not rely on the operating system to process the
 filesystems, deleted and hidden content is shown.
 .
 The volume system (media management) tools allow you to examine the layout of
 disks and other media. You can also recover deleted files, get information
 stored in slack spaces, examine filesystems journal, see partitions layout on
 disks or images etc. But is very important clarify that the TSK acts over the
 current filesystem only.
 .
 The Sleuth Kit supports DOS partitions, BSD partitions (disk labels), Mac
 partitions, Sun slices (Volume Table of Contents), and GPT disks. With these
 tools, you can identify where partitions are located and extract them so that
 they can be analyzed with filesystem analysis tools.
 .
 Currently, TSK supports several filesystems, as NTFS, FAT, exFAT, HFS+, Ext3,
 Ext4, UFS and YAFFS2.
 .
 This package contains the set of command line tools in The Sleuth Kit.

Description: system and service manager
 systemd is a system and service manager for Linux. It provides aggressive
 parallelization capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting
 services, offers on-demand starting of daemons, keeps track of processes using
 Linux control groups, maintains mount and automount points and implements an
 elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic.
 .
 systemd is compatible with SysV and LSB init scripts and can work as a
 drop-in replacement for sysvinit.
 .
 Installing the systemd package will not switch your init system unless you
 boot with init=/lib/systemd/systemd or install systemd-sysv in addition.

Architecture: arm64

Version: 1.41-3
Depends: libc6 (>= 2.17)
Description: Collection of simple Type 1 font manipulation programs
 The t1utils tools allow you to convert between PFA (ASCII) and PFB
 (binary) formats; disassemble PFA or PFB files into human-readable
 form; and reassemble the human-readable files into PFA or PFB format
 files.  You can also  extract font resources from a Macintosh font
 file (ATM/Laserwriter), or create a Macintosh Type 1 font file from a
 PFA or PFB font.
 .
 There are currently six programs:
 .
  t1ascii   Converts PFB files to PFA format.
 .
  t1binary  Converts PFA files to PFB format.
 .
  t1disasm  Disassembles a Type 1 font (PFA or PFB format) into a raw,
            human-readable text form for subsequent hand editing,
            tweaking, hint fixing, etcetera...
 .
  t1asm     Assembles a Type 1 font into PFA or PFB format from
            the human-readable form produced by t1disasm.
 .
  t1unmac   Extracts POST resources from a Macintosh Type 1 font file
            (ATM/Laserwriter) into PFA or PFB format for use outside
            the Macintosh environment.  The Macintosh file should be
            stored in MacBinary, AppleSingle, AppleDouble, or BinHex
            format, or as a raw resource fork.  Note that t1unmac does
            not have to run on a Macintosh, but makes Macintosh Type 1
            fonts available for use on Unix machines and PCs.
 .
  t1mac     Creates a Macintosh Type 1 file from a PFA- or PFB-format
            Type 1 font. Writes the Macintosh file in MacBinary,
            AppleSingle, AppleDouble, or BinHex format, or as a raw
            resource fork.  WARNING: This tool will not suffice to
            allow you to use the new font on a Macintosh, as
            Macintoshes cannot read raw Type 1 fonts.  You will need
            to create a font suitcase containing bitmap fonts.  If you
            do not already have such a suitcase for the font, T1utils
            will not help you create one.

 This package ships links to all the fonts that are originally in TeX Live,
 collection fonts-extra, but are not shipped in the Debian package
 texlive-fonts-extra due to availability in separate  packages. . For
 documents searching these fonts by file name instead of using fontconfig
 lookups, the font files need to be linked into the TEXMF tree of TeX Live.
 This package ships these links and depends on all the font packages
 required.

Description: system for processing phonetic symbols in LaTeX
 TIPA is a system for processing IPA (International Phonetic
 Alphabet) symbols in LaTeX written by Fukui Rei.  TIPA stands for
 either TeX IPA or Tokyo IPA and derived from the tsipa package, made
 in 1992 by Kobayashi Hajime, Fukui Rei and Shirakawa Shun.
 .
 Among many features of TIPA, the following are the new features as
 compared with tsipa or any other existing systems for processing IPA
 symbols:
 .
   * A new 256 character encoding for phonetic symbols (`T3'), which
     includes all the symbols and diacritics found in the recent
     versions of IPA and some non-IPA symbols.
   * Complete support of LaTeX2e.
   * Roman, slanted, bold, bold extended and sans serif font styles.
   * Easy input method in the IPA environment.
   * Extended macros for accents and diacritics.
   * A flexible system of macros for `tone letters'.
   * An optional package (vowel.sty) for drawing vowel diagrams.
   * A slightly modified set of fonts that go well when used with
     Times Roman and Helvetica fonts.
 .
 Type 1 fonts for TIPA are also included in this package (to make them
 available in X11 applications other than LaTeX, please install the
 xfonts-tipa package).

 Debian policy mandates that user changes to configuration files must be
 preserved during package upgrades. The easy way to achieve this behavior
 is to make the configuration file a 'conffile', in which case dpkg
 handles the file specially during upgrades, prompting the user as
 needed.
 .
 This is appropriate only if it is possible to distribute a default
 version that will work for most installations, although some system
 administrators may choose to modify it. This implies that the
 default version will be part of the package distribution, and must
 not be modified by the maintainer scripts during installation (or at
 any other time).
 .
 This script attempts to provide conffile-like handling for files that
 may not be labelled conffiles, and are not shipped in a Debian package,
 but handled by the postinst instead. This script allows one to
 maintain files in /etc, preserving user changes and in general
 offering the same facilities while upgrading that dpkg normally
 provides for 'conffiles'.
 .
 Additionally, this script provides facilities for transitioning a
 file that had not been provided with conffile-like protection to come
 under this schema, and attempts to minimize questions asked at
 installation time. Indeed, the transitioning facility is better than the
 one offered by dpkg while transitioning a file from a non-conffile to
 conffile status.

Description: mode switching tool for controlling "flip flop" USB devices
 Several new USB devices have their proprietary Windows drivers onboard,
 especially WAN dongles. When plugged in for the first time, they act
 like a flash storage and start installing the driver from there. If
 the driver is already installed, the storage device vanishes and
 a new device, such as an USB modem, shows up. This is called the
 "ZeroCD" feature.
 .
 On Debian, this is not needed, since the driver is included as a
 Linux kernel module, such as "usbserial". However, the device still
 shows up as "usb-storage" by default. usb-modeswitch solves that
 issue by sending the command which actually performs the switching
 of the device from "usb-storage" to "usbserial".
 .

Description: retrieves files from the web
 Wget is a network utility to retrieve files from the web
 using HTTP(S) and FTP, the two most widely used internet
 protocols. It works non-interactively, so it will work in
 the background, after having logged off. The program supports
 recursive retrieval of web-authoring pages as well as FTP
 sites -- you can use Wget to make mirrors of archives and
 home pages or to travel the web like a WWW robot.
 .
 Wget works particularly well with slow or unstable connections
 by continuing to retrieve a document until the document is fully
 downloaded. Re-getting files from where it left off works on
 servers (both HTTP and FTP) that support it. Both HTTP and FTP
 retrievals can be time stamped, so Wget can see if the remote
 file has changed since the last retrieval and automatically
 retrieve the new version if it has.
 .
 Wget supports proxy servers; this can lighten the network load,
 speed up retrieval, and provide access behind firewalls.

Description: X11 utilities
 An X client is a program that interfaces with an X server (almost always via
 the X libraries), and thus with some input and output hardware like a
 graphics card, monitor, keyboard, and pointing device (such as a mouse).
 .
 This package provides a miscellaneous assortment of X utilities
 that ship with the X Window System, including:
  - appres, editres, listres and viewres, which query the X resource database;
  - luit, a filter that can be run between an arbitrary application and a
    UTF-8 terminal emulator;
  - xdpyinfo, a display information utility for X;
  - xdriinfo, query configuration information of DRI drivers;
  - xev, an X event displayer;
  - xfd, a tool that displays all the glyphs in a given X font;
  - xfontsel, a tool for browsing and selecting X fonts;
  - xkill, a tool for terminating misbehaving X clients;
  - xlsatoms, which lists interned atoms defined on an X server;
  - xlsclients, which lists client applications running on an X display;
  - xlsfonts, a server font list displayer;
  - xmessage, a tool to display message or dialog boxes;
  - xprop, a property displayer for X;
  - xvinfo, an Xv extension information utility for X;
  - xwininfo, a window information utility for X;
 .
 The editres and viewres programs use bitmap images provided by the
 xbitmaps package. The luit program requires locale information from
 the libx11-data package.

Description: tool to manage well known user directories
 xdg-user-dirs is a tool to help manage "well known" user directories
 like the desktop folder and the music folder. It also handles
 localization (i.e. translation) of the filenames.
 .
 The way it works is that xdg-user-dirs-update is run very early in the
 login phase. This program reads a configuration file, and a set of
 default directories. It then creates localized versions of these
 directories in the users home directory and sets up a config file in
 $(XDG_CONFIG_HOME)/user-dirs.dirs (XDG_CONFIG_HOME defaults to
 ~/.config) that applications can read to find these directories.

Description: X terminal emulator
 xterm is a terminal emulator for the X Window System.  It provides DEC VT102
 and Tektronix 4014 compatible terminals for programs that cannot use the
 window system directly.  This version implements ISO/ANSI colors and most of
 the control sequences used by DEC VT220 terminals.
 .
 This package provides four commands: xterm, which is the traditional
 terminal emulator; uxterm, which is a wrapper around xterm that is
 intelligent about locale settings (especially those which use the UTF-8
 character encoding), but which requires the luit program from the x11-utils
 package; koi8rxterm, a wrapper similar to uxterm for locales that use the
 KOI8-R character set; and lxterm, a simple wrapper that chooses which of the
 previous commands to execute based on the user's locale settings.
 .
 A complete list of control sequences supported by the X terminal emulator
 is provided in /usr/share/doc/xterm.
 .
 The xterm program uses bitmap images provided by the xbitmaps package.
 .
 Those interested in using koi8rxterm will likely want to install the
 xfonts-cyrillic package as well.

Description: XZ-format compression utilities
 XZ is the successor to the Lempel-Ziv/Markov-chain Algorithm
 compression format, which provides memory-hungry but powerful
 compression (often better than bzip2) and fast, easy decompression.
 .
 This package provides the command line tools for working with XZ
 compression, including xz, unxz, xzcat, xzgrep, and so on. They can
 also handle the older LZMA format, and if invoked via appropriate
 symlinks will emulate the behavior of the commands in the lzma
 package.
 .
 The XZ format is similar to the older LZMA format but includes some
 improvements for general use:
 .
  * 'file' magic for detecting XZ files;
  * crc64 data integrity check;
  * limited random-access reading support;
  * improved support for multithreading (not used in xz-utils);
  * support for flushing the encoder.
