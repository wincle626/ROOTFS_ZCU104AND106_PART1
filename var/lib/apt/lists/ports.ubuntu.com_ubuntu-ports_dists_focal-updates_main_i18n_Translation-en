 Thunderbolt 3 features different security modes that require
 devices to be authorized before they can be used. The D-Bus API can be
 used to list devices, enroll them (authorize and store them in the
 local database) and forget them again (remove previously enrolled
 devices). It also emits signals if new devices are connected (or
 removed). During enrollment devices can be set to be automatically
 authorized as soon as they are connected.  A command line tool, called
 boltctl, can be used to control the daemon and perform all the above
 mentioned tasks.

 considered essential for building Debian packages.  This package also
 depends on the packages on that list, to make it easy to have the
 build-essential packages installed.
 .
 If you have this package installed, you only need to install whatever
 a package specifies as its build-time dependencies to build the
 package.  Conversely, if you are determining what your package needs
 to build-depend on, you can always leave out the packages this
 package depends on.

 build-essential; the real definition is in the Debian Policy Manual.
 This package contains merely an informational list, which is all
 most people need.   However, if this package and the manual disagree,
 the manual is correct.

Package: busybox-initramfs

Description-en: Standalone shell setup for initramfs
 BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single
 small executable. It provides minimalist replacements for the most common
 utilities you would usually find on your desktop system (i.e., ls, cp, mv,
 mount, tar, etc.). The utilities in BusyBox generally have fewer options than
 their full-featured GNU cousins; however, the options that are included
 provide the expected functionality and behave very much like their GNU
 counterparts.
 .
 busybox-initramfs provides a simple stand alone shell that provides
 only the basic utilities needed for the initramfs.

Package: busybox-static

 their full-featured GNU cousins; however, the options that are included
 provide the expected functionality and behave very much like their GNU
 counterparts.
 .

 your system from certain destruction. Invoke "busybox", and it will list the
 available builtin commands.

Package: busybox-syslogd
Description-md5: 6d204aacbcadc9711030ab99f904ca3b
Description-en: Provides syslogd and klogd using busybox
 The system log daemon is responsible for providing logging of
 messages received from programs and facilities on the local host as
 well as from remote hosts.
 .
 The kernel log daemon listens to kernel message sources and is
 responsible for prioritizing and processing operating system
 messages.
 .
 The busybox implementation of the syslogd is particular useful on
 embedded, diskless (netboot) or flash disk based systems because it
 can use a fixed size ring buffer for logging instead of saving logs
 to the disk or sending it to remote logging servers. The ring buffer
 can be read using the (also busybox based) command logread.
 .
 This package provides the glue to the busybox syslogd and klogd to be
 used in the system by providing the appropriate symbolic links and
 scripts.

 relative to other systems and adjusts the system time accordingly. For
 isolated systems, the user can periodically enter the correct time by
 hand (using 'chronyc'). In either case 'chronyd' determines the rate
 at which the computer gains or loses time, and compensates for this.
 Chronyd implements the NTP protocol and can act as either a client or
 a server.

 The core analysis suite is a self-contained tool that can be used to
 investigate either live systems, or multiple different core dump formats
 including kdump, LKCD, netdump and diskdump.
 .
 o  The tool is loosely based on the SVR4 crash command, but has been
    completely integrated with gdb in order to be able to display
    formatted kernel data structures, disassemble source code, etc.
 .
 o  The current set of available commands consist of common kernel core
    analysis tools such as a context-specific stack traces, source code
    disassembly, kernel variable displays, memory display, dumps of
    linked-lists, etc.  In addition, any gdb command may be entered,
    which in turn will be passed onto the gdb module for execution.
 .
 o  There are several commands that delve deeper into specific kernel
    subsystems, which also serve as templates for kernel developers
    to create new commands for analysis of a specific area of interest.
    Adding a new command is a simple affair, and a quick recompile
    adds it to the command menu.
 .
 o  The intent is to make the tool independent of Linux version dependencies,
    building in recognition of major kernel code changes so as to adapt to
    new kernel versions, while maintaining backwards compatibility.

Description-en: simple interprocess messaging system (daemon and utilities)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus
 decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be
 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using
 XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but
 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.
 .
 It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.

Description-en: simple interprocess messaging system (systemd --user integration)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 On systemd systems, this package opts in to the session model in which
 a user's session starts the first time they log in, and does not end
 until all their login sessions have ended. This model merges all
 parallel non-graphical login sessions (text mode, ssh, cron, etc.), and up
 to one graphical session, into a single "user-session" or "super-session"
 within which all background D-Bus services are shared.
 .
 Multiple graphical sessions per user are not currently supported in this
 mode; as a result, it is particularly suitable for gdm, which responds to
 requests to open a parallel graphical session by switching to the existing
 graphical session and unlocking it.
 .
 To retain dbus' traditional session semantics, in which login sessions
 are artificially isolated from each other, remove this package and install
 dbus-x11 instead.

Package: gamemode
Description-md5: 337f41a7748ae4923b61503cbad42837
Description-en: Optimise Linux system performance on demand
 GameMode is a daemon/lib combo for Linux that allows games to request a set
 of optimisations be temporarily applied to the host OS.
 .
 The design has a clear-cut abstraction between the host daemon and library
 (gamemoded and libgamemode), and the client loaders (libgamemodeauto and
 gamemode_client.h) that allows for safe use without worrying about whether
 the daemon is installed or running. This design also means that while the
 host library currently relies on systemd for exchanging messages with the
 daemon, it's entirely possible to implement other internals that still work
 with the same clients.
 .
 GameMode was designed primarily as a stop-gap solution to problems with
 the Intel and AMD CPU powersave or ondemand governors, but is intended to
 be expanded beyond just CPU governor states, as there are a wealth of
 automation tasks one might want to apply.
 .
 This package includes a program called '/usr/libexec/gamemode-simulate-game',
 which invokes gamemode, sleeps for 10 seconds and then exits. This allows you
 to test whether gamemode is working properly on your system, it will
 return gamemode's error message if something went wrong, otherwise it
 will exit with a 0 status.

Package: libgamemode-dev
Description-md5: 59f73c069c8f0bc5fb1877f8c3f23ee5
Description-en: Optimise Linux system performance on demand (dev files)
 GameMode is a daemon/lib combo for Linux that allows games to request a set
 of optimisations be temporarily applied to the host OS.
 .
 The design has a clear-cut abstraction between the host daemon and library
 (gamemoded and libgamemode), and the client loaders (libgamemodeauto and
 gamemode_client.h) that allows for safe use without worrying about whether
 the daemon is installed or running. This design also means that while the
 host library currently relies on systemd for exchanging messages with the
 daemon, it's entirely possible to implement other internals that still work
 with the same clients.
 .
 GameMode was designed primarily as a stop-gap solution to problems with
 the Intel and AMD CPU powersave or ondemand governors, but is intended to
 be expanded beyond just CPU governor states, as there are a wealth of
 automation tasks one might want to apply.
 .
 This package provides the development files for the base library
 for gamemode.

 Danga Interactive developed memcached to enhance the speed of LiveJournal.com,
 a site which was already doing 20 million+ dynamic page views per day for 1
 million users with a bunch of webservers and a bunch of database servers.
 memcached dropped the database load to almost nothing, yielding faster page
 load times for users, better resource utilization, and faster access to the
 databases on a memcache miss.
 .
 memcached optimizes specific high-load serving applications that are designed
 to take advantage of its versatile no-locking memory access system. Clients
 are available in several different programming languages, to suit the needs
 of the specific application. Traditionally this has been used in mod_perl
 apps to avoid storing large chunks of data in Apache memory, and to share
 this burden across several machines.

 boot-up, so that it can test *all* of your memory.  You may want to
 look at `memtester', which allows to test your memory within Linux,
 but this one won't be able to test your whole RAM.
 .
 It can output a list of bad RAM regions usable by the BadRAM kernel
 patch, so that you can still use your old RAM with one or two bad bits.
 .
 Memtest86+ is based on memtest86 3.0, and adds support for recent
 hardware, as well as a number of general-purpose improvements,
 including many patches to memtest86 available from various sources.
 .
 Both memtest86 and memtest86+ are being worked on in parallel.

Package: python-swiftclient-doc
Description-md5: 0084b509d64d02182b09ca5a4a938417
Description-en: Client library for Openstack Swift API - doc
 OpenStack Object Storage (code-named Swift) creates redundant, scalable object
 storage using clusters of standardized servers to store petabytes of
 accessible data. It is not a file system or real-time data storage system, but
 rather a long-term storage system for a more permanent type of static data
 that can be retrieved, leveraged, and then updated if necessary. Primary
 examples of data that best fit this type of storage model are virtual machine
 images, photo storage, email storage and backup archiving. Having no central
 "brain" or master point of control provides greater scalability, redundancy
 and permanence.
 .
 Objects are written to multiple hardware devices in the data center, with
 the OpenStack software responsible for ensuring data replication and
 integrity across the cluster. Storage clusters can scale horizontally by
 adding new nodes. Should a node fail, OpenStack works to replicate its
 content from other active nodes. Because OpenStack uses software logic to
 ensure data replication and distribution across different devices,
 inexpensive commodity hard drives and servers can be used in lieu of more
 expensive equipment.
 .
 This package provides a client for the OpenStack Swift API. There's a Python
 API  (the "swiftclient" module), and a command-line script ("swift").
 .
 This package contains the documentation.

Package: python3-swift
Description-md5: 72c8e0f7c41fa180184a3c3196e4facc
Description-en: distributed virtual object store - Python 3 libraries
 OpenStack Object Storage (code-named Swift) is open source software for
 creating redundant, scalable object storage using clusters of standardized
 servers to store petabytes of accessible data. It is not a file system or
 real-time data storage system, but rather a long-term storage system for a
 more permanent type of static data that can be retrieved, leveraged, and then
 updated if necessary. Primary examples of data that best fit this type of
 storage model are virtual machine images, photo storage, email storage and
 backup archiving. Having no central "brain" or master point of control
 provides greater scalability, redundancy and permanence.
 .
 Objects are written to multiple hardware devices in the data center, with
 the OpenStack software responsible for ensuring data replication and
 integrity across the cluster. Storage clusters can scale horizontally by
 adding new nodes. Should a node fail, OpenStack works to replicate its
 content from other active nodes. Because OpenStack uses software logic to
 ensure data replication and distribution across different devices,
 inexpensive commodity hard drives and servers can be used in lieu of more
 expensive equipment.
 .
 This package provides the Python 3 libraries that actually implement
 everything.

Description-en: distributed virtual object store - common files
 OpenStack Object Storage (code-named Swift) is open source software for
 creating redundant, scalable object storage using clusters of standardized
 servers to store petabytes of accessible data. It is not a file system or
 real-time data storage system, but rather a long-term storage system for a
 more permanent type of static data that can be retrieved, leveraged, and then
 updated if necessary. Primary examples of data that best fit this type of
 storage model are virtual machine images, photo storage, email storage and
 backup archiving. Having no central "brain" or master point of control
 provides greater scalability, redundancy and permanence.
 .
 Objects are written to multiple hardware devices in the data center, with
 the OpenStack software responsible for ensuring data replication and
 integrity across the cluster. Storage clusters can scale horizontally by
 adding new nodes. Should a node fail, OpenStack works to replicate its
 content from other active nodes. Because OpenStack uses software logic to
 ensure data replication and distribution across different devices,
 inexpensive commodity hard drives and servers can be used in lieu of more
 expensive equipment.
 .
 This package provides some core binaries and clients to control swift.
