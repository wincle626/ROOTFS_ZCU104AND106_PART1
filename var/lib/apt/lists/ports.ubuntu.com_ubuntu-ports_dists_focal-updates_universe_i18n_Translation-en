Description-en: OpenStack Load Balancer Service - Amphora agent
 Openstack Load Balancer as a Service, codenamed Octavia was borne
 out of the Neutron LBaaS project. Its conception influenced
 the transformation of the Neutron LBaaS project, as Neutron LBaaS
 moved from version 1 to version 2. Starting with the Liberty
 release of OpenStack, Octavia has become the reference implementation
 for Neutron LBaaS version 2.
 .
 Octavia accomplishes its delivery of load balancing services by
 managing a fleet of virtual machines, containers, or bare metal
 servers—collectively known as amphorae— which it spins up on demand.
 This on-demand, horizontal scaling feature differentiates Octavia from
 other load balancing solutions, thereby making Octavia truly
 suited “for the cloud.”.

Package: ctdb
Description-md5: 83dff66615250b53a0cd3df6fb3b9ea7
Description-en: clustered database to store temporary data
 CTDB is a cluster implementation of the TDB database used by Samba and other
 projects to store temporary data. If an application is already using TDB for
 temporary data it is very easy to convert that application to be cluster aware
 and use CTDB instead.
 .
 CTDB provides the same types of functions as TDB but in a clustered fashion,
 providing a TDB-style database that spans multiple physical hosts in a cluster.
 .
 Features include:
  * CTDB provides a TDB that has consistent data and consistent locking across
    all nodes in a cluster.
  * CTDB is very fast.
  * In case of node failures, CTDB will automatically recover and repair all TDB
    databases that it manages.
  * CTDB is the core component that provides pCIFS ("parallel CIFS") with
    Samba3/4.
  * CTDB provides HA features such as node monitoring, node failover, and IP
    takeover.
  * CTDB provides a reliable messaging transport to allow applications linked
    with CTDB to communicate to other instances of the application running on
    different nodes in the cluster.
  * CTDB has pluggable transport backends. Currently implemented backends are
    TCP and Infiniband.
  * CTDB supports a system of application specific management scripts, allowing
    applications that depend on network or filesystem resources to be managed in
    a highly available manner on a cluster.

Package: cvise
Description-md5: 0d97eed0474b333b884c9bef9da0e19d
Description-en: super-parallel Python port of the C-Reduce project
 C-Vise is a tool that takes a large C, C++ or OpenCL program that has
 a property of interest (such as triggering a compiler bug) and
 automatically produces a much smaller C/C++ or OpenCL program that
 has the same property. It is intended for use by people who discover
 and report bugs in compilers and other tools that process C/C++ or
 OpenCL code.
 .
 NOTE: C-Vise happens to do a pretty good job reducing the size of
 programs in languages other than C/C++, such as JavaScript and
 Rust. If you need to reduce programs in some other language, please
 give it a try.

Package: davfs2
Description-md5: f8eed21b7f3e0ce6b263a0f4db368796
Description-en: mount a WebDAV resource as a regular file system
 Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV), an extension to the
 HTTP-protocol, allows authoring of resources on a remote
 web server. davfs2 provides the ability to access such resources like
 a typical filesystem, allowing for use by standard applications with no
 built-in support for WebDAV.
 .
 davfs2 is designed to fully integrate into the filesystem semantics of
 Unix-like systems (mount, umount, et c.). davfs2 makes
 mounting by unprivileged users as easy and secure as possible.
 .
 davfs2 does extensive caching to make the file system responsive,
 to avoid unnecessary network traffic and to prevent data loss, and to cope
 for slow or unreliable connections.
 .
 davfs2 will work with most WebDAV servers needing little or no configuration.

Package: flatpak
Description-md5: f91acb1d2880527b2759bc5e2d99fbff
Description-en: Application deployment framework for desktop apps
 Flatpak installs, manages and runs sandboxed desktop application bundles.
 Application bundles run partially isolated from the wider system, using
 containerization techniques such as namespaces to prevent direct access
 to system resources. Resources from outside the sandbox can be accessed
 via "portal" services, which are responsible for access control; for
 example, the Documents portal displays an "Open" dialog outside the
 sandbox, then allows the application to access only the selected file.
 .
 Each application uses a specified "runtime", or set of libraries, which is
 available as /usr inside its sandbox. This can be used to run application
 bundles with multiple, potentially incompatible sets of dependencies within
 the same desktop environment.
 .
 This package contains the services and executables needed to install and
 launch sandboxed applications, and the portal services needed to provide
 limited access to resources outside the sandbox.

Description-en: Go programming language compiler - metapackage
 The Go programming language is an open source project to make
 programmers more productive. Go is expressive, concise, clean, and
 efficient. Its concurrency mechanisms make it easy to write programs
 that get the most out of multicore and networked machines, while its
 novel type system enables flexible and modular program construction.
 Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the convenience of
 garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection. It's a
 fast, statically typed, compiled language that feels like a
 dynamically typed, interpreted language.
 .
 This package is a metapackage that, when installed, guarantees
 that (most of) a full Go development environment is installed.

Package: golang-1.16-go
Description-md5: 9791676e1d7825e569bdb76ce1ad2e08
Description-en: Go programming language compiler, linker, compiled stdlib
 The Go programming language is an open source project to make programmers more
 productive. Go is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient. Its concurrency
 mechanisms make it easy to write programs that get the most out of multicore
 and networked machines, while its novel type system enables flexible and
 modular program construction. Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the
 convenience of garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection. It's a
 fast, statically typed, compiled language that feels like a dynamically typed,
 interpreted language.
 .
 This package provides an assembler, compiler, linker, and compiled libraries
 for the Go programming language.
 .
 Go supports cross-compilation, but as of Go 1.5, it is no longer necessary to
 pre-compile the standard library inside GOROOT for cross-compilation to work.

Package: gosu
Description-md5: 72c0b42347139534207936c653f27fc4
Description-en: Simple Go-based setuid+setgid+setgroups+exec
 This is a simple tool grown out of the simple fact that "su" and "sudo" have
 very strange and often annoying TTY and signal-forwarding behavior. They're
 also somewhat complex to setup and use (especially in the case of "sudo"),
 which allows for a great deal of expressivity, but falls flat if all you need
 is "run this specific application as this specific user and get out of the
 pipeline".
 .
 The core of how "gosu" works is stolen directly from how Docker/libcontainer
 itself starts an application inside a container (and in fact, is using the
 "/etc/passwd" processing code directly from libcontainer's codebase).
 .
 Once the user/group is processed, we switch to that user, then we "exec" the
 specified process and "gosu" itself is no longer resident or involved in the
 process lifecycle at all. This avoids all the issues of signal passing and TTY,
 and punts them to the process invoking "gosu" and the process being invoked by
 "gosu", where they belong.

Package: gpgv-static

 so that it can be directly used on any platform that is running on
 the Linux kernel.  Android and ChromeOS are two well known examples,
 but there are many other platforms that this will work for, like
 embedded Linux OSes.  This gpgv in combination with debootstrap and
 the Debian archive keyring allows the secure creation of chroot
 installs on these platforms by using the full Debian signature
 verification that is present in all official Debian mirrors.

 OTR allows you to have private conversations over IM by providing:
  * Encryption - no one else can read your instant messages.
  * Authentication - you are assured the correspondent is who you think
    it is.
  * Deniability - the messages you send do _not_ have digital signatures
    that are checkable by a third party. Anyone can forge messages after
    a conversation to make them look like they came from you. However,
    _during_ a conversation, correspondents are assured the messages
    they see are authentic and unmodified.
  * Forward secrecy - if you lose control of your private keys,
    no previous conversation is compromised.

Package: lemon
Description-md5: 867ddd6dcabf45fb31853e332c544f1f
Description-en: LALR(1) Parser Generator for C or C++
 Lemon is an LALR(1) parser generator for C or C++. It does the same
 job as bison and yacc. But lemon is not another bison or yacc
 clone. It uses a different grammar syntax which is designed to reduce
 the number of coding errors. Lemon also uses a more sophisticated
 parsing engine that is faster than yacc and bison and which is both
 reentrant and thread-safe. Furthermore, Lemon implements features
 that can be used to eliminate resource leaks, making is suitable for
 use in long-running programs such as graphical user interfaces or
 embedded controllers.

Package: libfuzzer-11-dev
Description-md5: bc55cd127b8dab148b78e61e5e475b8e
Description-en: Library for coverage-guided fuzz testing
 LibFuzzer is a library for in-process, coverage-guided, evolutionary fuzzing
 of other libraries.
 .
 LibFuzzer is similar in concept to American Fuzzy Lop (AFL), but it performs
 all of its fuzzing inside a single process. This in-process fuzzing can be
 more restrictive and fragile, but is potentially much faster as there is no
 overhead for process start-up.
 .
 The fuzzer is linked with the library under test, and feeds fuzzed inputs to
 the library via a specific fuzzing entrypoint (aka 'target function'); the
 fuzzer then tracks which areas of the code are reached, and generates mutations
 on the corpus of input data in order to maximize the code coverage. The code
 coverage information for libFuzzer is provided by LLVM's SanitizerCoverage
 instrumentation.

Description-en: Modular compiler and toolchain technologies, OCaml bindings
 LLVM is a collection of libraries and tools that make it easy to build
 compilers, optimizers, just-in-time code generators, and many other
 compiler-related programs.
 .
 LLVM uses a single, language-independent virtual instruction set both
 as an offline code representation (to communicate code between
 compiler phases and to run-time systems) and as the compiler internal
 representation (to analyze and transform programs). This persistent
 code representation allows a common set of sophisticated compiler
 techniques to be applied at compile-time, link-time, install-time,
 run-time, or "idle-time" (between program runs).
 .
 This package provides the OCaml bindings to develop applications using llvm.

Description-en: rendering library for openbox themes
 Openbox works with your applications, and makes your desktop easier to manage.
 This is because the approach to its development was the opposite of what seems
 to be the general case for window managers. Openbox was written first to
 comply with standards and to work properly. Only when that was in place did
 the team turn to the visual interface.
 .
 Openbox is fully functional as a stand-alone working environment, or can be
 used as a drop-in replacement for the default window manager in the GNOME or
 KDE desktop environments.
 .
 Openbox 3 is a completely new breed of window manager. It is not based upon
 any existing code base, although the visual appearance has been based upon
 that of Blackbox. Openbox 2 was based on the Blackbox 0.65.0 codebase.
 .
 This package contains the libobrender library files used by openbox

Description-en: FFmpeg library for audio resampling, rematrixing etc. - development files
 FFmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode, transcode,
 mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything that humans and
 machines have created. It supports the most obscure ancient formats up to the
 cutting edge.
 .
 This library provides performs highly optimized audio resampling, rematrixing
 and sample format conversion operations.
 Specifically, this library performs the following conversions:
  * Resampling is the process of changing the audio rate, for example from a
    high sample rate of 44100Hz to 8000Hz. Audio conversion from high to low
    sample rate is a lossy process. Several resampling options and algorithms
    are available.
  * Rematrixing is the process of changing the channel layout, for example from
    stereo to mono. When the input channels cannot be mapped to the output
    streams, the process is lossy, since it involves different gain factors
    and mixing. Various other audio conversions (e.g. stretching and padding)
    are enabled through dedicated options.
  * Format conversion is the process of converting the type of samples, for
    example from 16-bit signed samples to unsigned 8-bit or float samples.
    It also handles packing conversion, when passing from packed layout (all
    samples belonging to distinct channels interleaved in the same buffer), to
    planar layout (all samples belonging to the same channel stored in a
    dedicated buffer or "plane").

Package: libtcmu2
Description-md5: 4412c81ce6b855cdb9e1ccd39b88a1c5
Description-en: Library that handles the userspace side of the LIO TCM-User backstore
 LIO is the SCSI target in the Linux kernel. It is entirely kernel
 code, and allows exported SCSI logical units (LUNs) to be backed by
 regular files or block devices. But, if one want to get fancier with
 the capabilities of the device one is emulating, the kernel is not
 necessarily the right place. While there are userspace libraries for
 compression, encryption, and clustered storage solutions like Ceph or
 Gluster, these are not accessible from the kernel.
 .
 The TCMU userspace-passthrough backstore allows a userspace process
 to handle requests to a LUN. But since the kernel-user interface that
 TCMU provides must be fast and flexible, it is complex enough that
 one would like to avoid each userspace handler having to write boilerplate
 code.
 .
 tcmu-runner handles the messy details of the TCMU interface -- UIO,
 netlink, pthreads, and DBus -- and exports a more friendly C plugin
 module API. Modules using this API are called "TCMU
 handlers". Handler authors can write code just to handle the SCSI
 commands as desired, and can also link with whatever userspace
 libraries they like.
 .
 This is the library package

Package: libxstream-java
Description-md5: 10c1dedc8716f96d83e51d094ab4032b
Description-en: Java library to serialize objects to XML and back again
 The features of the XStream library are:
 .
  - Ease of use. A high level facade is supplied that simplifies common
    use cases.
  - No mappings required. Most objects can be serialized without need
    for specifying mappings.
  - Performance. Speed and low memory footprint are a crucial part of
    the design, making it suitable for large object graphs or systems
    with high message throughput.
  - Clean XML. No information is duplicated that can be obtained via
    reflection. This results in XML that is easier to read for humans
    and more compact than native Java serialization.
  - Requires no modifications to objects. Serializes internal fields,
    including private and final. Supports non-public and inner classes.
    Classes are not required to have default constructor.
  - Full object graph support. Duplicate references encountered in the
    object-model will be maintained. Supports circular references.
  - Integrates with other XML APIs. By implementing an interface,
    XStream can serialize directly to/from any tree structure (not just
    XML).
  - Customizable conversion strategies. Strategies can be registered
    allowing customization of how particular types are represented as
    XML.
  - Error messages. When an exception occurs due to malformed XML,
    detailed diagnostics are provided to help isolate and fix the
    problem.
  - Alternative output format. The modular design allows other output
    formats. XStream ships currently with JSON support and morphing.

Description-md5: cb370b8d5216a7ee6a5025cd0a804f1f
Description-en: kernel module to memory dump (DKMS)
 LiME (Linux Memory Extractor, formerly DMD) is a Loadable Kernel
 Module (LKM), which allows the acquisition of volatile memory (RAM)
 from Linux and Linux-based devices, such as those powered by Android.
 In others words, you can use it to get a memory image from a machine.
 .
 The tool supports acquiring memory either to the file system of the
 device or over the network. LiME is unique in that it is the first
 tool that allows full memory captures from Android devices. It also
 minimizes its interaction between user and kernel space processes
 during acquisition. It will produce memory captures that are more
 forensically sound than those of other tools designed for Linux
 memory acquisition. The dump format provided as "lime" is fully
 compatible with volatility framework.
 .
 This package provides the source code for the lime-forensics kernel
 modules to be build with dkms.

Description-en: Modular compiler and toolchain technologies
 LLVM is a collection of libraries and tools that make it easy to build
 compilers, optimizers, just-in-time code generators, and many other
 compiler-related programs.
 .
 LLVM uses a single, language-independent virtual instruction set both
 as an offline code representation (to communicate code between
 compiler phases and to run-time systems) and as the compiler internal
 representation (to analyze and transform programs). This persistent
 code representation allows a common set of sophisticated compiler
 techniques to be applied at compile-time, link-time, install-time,
 run-time, or "idle-time" (between program runs).
 .
 The strengths of the LLVM infrastructure are its extremely
 simple design (which makes it easy to understand and use),
 source-language independence, powerful mid-level optimizer, automated
 compiler debugging support, extensibility, and its stability and
 reliability. LLVM is currently being used to host a wide variety of
 academic research projects and commercial projects. LLVM includes C
 and C++ front-ends, a front-end for a Forth-like language (Stacker),
 a young scheme front-end, and Java support is in development. LLVM can
 generate code for X96, SparcV10, PowerPC or many other architectures.

Description-en: Modular compiler and toolchain technologies, libraries and headers
 LLVM is a collection of libraries and tools that make it easy to build
 compilers, optimizers, just-in-time code generators, and many other
 compiler-related programs.

 LLVM uses a single, language-independent virtual instruction set both
 as an offline code representation (to communicate code between
 compiler phases and to run-time systems) and as the compiler internal
 representation (to analyze and transform programs). This persistent
 code representation allows a common set of sophisticated compiler
 techniques to be applied at compile-time, link-time, install-time,

 Neutron dynamic routing enables advertisement of self-service (private)
 network prefixes to physical network devices that support dynamic routing
 protocols such as routers, thus removing the conventional dependency on static
 routes.
 .
 It advertises three classes of routes:
  * Host routes for floating IP addresses hosted on non-DVR routers, the
    nexthop is the centralized router.
  * Host routes for floating IP addresses hosted on DVR routers, the nexthop is
    the appropriate compute node.
  * Prefix routes for directly routable tenant networks with address scopes,
    the nexthop is the centralized router, the same for DVR and CVR.
 .
 Neutron dynamic routing consists of service plug-in and agent. The service
 plug-in implements the Networking service extension and the agent manages
 dynamic routing protocol peering sessions. The plug-in communicates with the
 agent through RPC.

 .
 Neutron dynamic routing enables advertisement of self-service (private)
 network prefixes to physical network devices that support dynamic routing
 protocols such as routers, thus removing the conventional dependency on static
 routes.
 .
 It advertises three classes of routes:
  * Host routes for floating IP addresses hosted on non-DVR routers, the
    nexthop is the centralized router.
  * Host routes for floating IP addresses hosted on DVR routers, the nexthop is
    the appropriate compute node.
  * Prefix routes for directly routable tenant networks with address scopes,
    the nexthop is the centralized router, the same for DVR and CVR.
 .
 Neutron dynamic routing consists of service plug-in and agent. The service
 plug-in implements the Networking service extension and the agent manages
 dynamic routing protocol peering sessions. The plug-in communicates with the
 agent through RPC.

 be fast, easy to administer, and secure, while at the same time being
 sendmail compatible enough to not upset existing users. Thus, the outside
 has a sendmail-ish flavor, but the inside is completely different.
 .
 This provides support for SQLite maps in Postfix. If you plan to use
 SQLite maps with Postfix, you need this.

Description-md5: 145e597bb8213f857ae5d54f860956e6
Description-en: Daemon that handles the userspace side of the LIO TCM-User backstore
 LIO is the SCSI target in the Linux kernel. It is entirely kernel
 code, and allows exported SCSI logical units (LUNs) to be backed by
 regular files or block devices. But, if one want to get fancier with
 the capabilities of the device one is emulating, the kernel is not
 necessarily the right place. While there are userspace libraries for
 compression, encryption, and clustered storage solutions like Ceph or
 Gluster, these are not accessible from the kernel.
 .
 The TCMU userspace-passthrough backstore allows a userspace process
 to handle requests to a LUN. But since the kernel-user interface that
 TCMU provides must be fast and flexible, it is complex enough that
 one would like to avoid each userspace handler having to write boilerplate
 code.
 .
 tcmu-runner handles the messy details of the TCMU interface -- UIO,
 netlink, pthreads, and DBus -- and exports a more friendly C plugin
 module API. Modules using this API are called "TCMU
 handlers". Handler authors can write code just to handle the SCSI
 commands as desired, and can also link with whatever userspace
 libraries they like.
 .
 This is the daemon package

Package: xterm
Description-md5: c1e47d60a01948be9aae7a2a4f63a0fe
Description-en: X terminal emulator
 xterm is a terminal emulator for the X Window System.  It provides DEC VT102
 and Tektronix 4014 compatible terminals for programs that cannot use the
 window system directly.  This version implements ISO/ANSI colors and most of
 the control sequences used by DEC VT220 terminals.
 .
 This package provides four commands: xterm, which is the traditional
 terminal emulator; uxterm, which is a wrapper around xterm that is
 intelligent about locale settings (especially those which use the UTF-8
 character encoding), but which requires the luit program from the x11-utils
 package; koi8rxterm, a wrapper similar to uxterm for locales that use the
 KOI8-R character set; and lxterm, a simple wrapper that chooses which of the
 previous commands to execute based on the user's locale settings.
 .
 A complete list of control sequences supported by the X terminal emulator
 is provided in /usr/share/doc/xterm.
 .
 The xterm program uses bitmap images provided by the xbitmaps package.
 .
 Those interested in using koi8rxterm will likely want to install the
 xfonts-cyrillic package as well.

Package: xvfb
Description-md5: 1cd5b85acd06c23d376b7b5a7f30a0b8
Description-en: Virtual Framebuffer 'fake' X server
 Xvfb provides an X server that can run on machines with no display hardware
 and no physical input devices. It emulates a dumb framebuffer using virtual
 memory. The primary use of this server was intended to be server testing,
 but other novel uses for it have been found, including testing clients
 against unusual depths and screen configurations, doing batch processing with
 Xvfb as a background rendering engine, load testing, as an aid to porting the
 X server to a new platform, and providing an unobtrusive way to run
 applications that don't really need an X server but insist on having one
 anyway.
 .
 This package also contains a convenience script called xvfb-run which
 simplifies the automated execution of X clients in a virtual server
 environment. This convenience script requires the use of the xauth
 program.
 .
 More information about X.Org can be found at:
 <URL:https://www.x.org>

 This package is built from the X.org xserver module.

Package: xzdec
Description-md5: 30227ffce3f42144b3b624776f996bbf
Description-en: XZ-format compression utilities - tiny decompressors
 XZ is the successor to the Lempel-Ziv/Markov-chain Algorithm
 compression format, which provides memory-hungry but powerful
 compression (often better than bzip2) and fast, easy decompression.
 .
 This package provides the xzdec and lzmadec utilities, which write
 the decompressed version of a compressed file to standard output. The
 binaries are very small, so they can be easily stored on small media
 with some compressed files, and they are linked statically against
 liblzma so they can be used on machines without a compatible version
 of liblzma installed. However, they have:
 .
   * no compression support;
   * no support for writing to a file other than standard output;
   * no translated messages;
   * been optimized for size rather than speed.
 .
 For a full-featured xzcat command without these limitations, use
 the xz-utils package instead.
