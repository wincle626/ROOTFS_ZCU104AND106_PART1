Package: busybox-initramfs
Description-md5: 07bc91bcf5e1da8f300c48c3d990ca10
Description-en: Standalone shell setup for initramfs
 BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single
 small executable. It provides minimalist replacements for the most common
 utilities you would usually find on your desktop system (i.e., ls, cp, mv,
 mount, tar, etc.). The utilities in BusyBox generally have fewer options than
 their full-featured GNU cousins; however, the options that are included
 provide the expected functionality and behave very much like their GNU
 counterparts.
 .
 busybox-initramfs provides a simple stand alone shell that provides
 only the basic utilities needed for the initramfs.

 busybox-static provides you with a statically linked simple stand alone shell
 that provides all the utilities available in BusyBox. This package is
 intended to be used as a rescue shell, in the event that you screw up your
 system. Invoke "busybox sh" and you have a standalone shell ready to save
 your system from certain destruction. Invoke "busybox", and it will list the
 available builtin commands.

Package: busybox-syslogd
Description-md5: 6d204aacbcadc9711030ab99f904ca3b
Description-en: Provides syslogd and klogd using busybox
 The system log daemon is responsible for providing logging of
 messages received from programs and facilities on the local host as
 well as from remote hosts.
 .
 The kernel log daemon listens to kernel message sources and is
 responsible for prioritizing and processing operating system
 messages.
 .
 The busybox implementation of the syslogd is particular useful on
 embedded, diskless (netboot) or flash disk based systems because it
 can use a fixed size ring buffer for logging instead of saving logs
 to the disk or sending it to remote logging servers. The ring buffer
 can be read using the (also busybox based) command logread.
 .
 This package provides the glue to the busybox syslogd and klogd to be
 used in the system by providing the appropriate symbolic links and
 scripts.

 chronyd:  This is a daemon which runs in background on the system.
 It obtains measurements (e.g. via the network) of the system's offset
 relative to other systems and adjusts the system time accordingly. For
 isolated systems, the user can periodically enter the correct time by
 hand (using 'chronyc'). In either case 'chronyd' determines the rate
 at which the computer gains or loses time, and compensates for this.
 Chronyd implements the NTP protocol and can act as either a client or
 a server.
 .
 chronyc: This is a command-line driven control and monitoring program.
 An administrator can use this to fine-tune various parameters within
 the daemon, add or delete servers etc whilst the daemon is running.

 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus
 decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be
 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using
 XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but
 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.
 .
 It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.

 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 On systemd systems, this package opts in to the session model in which
 a user's session starts the first time they log in, and does not end
 until all their login sessions have ended. This model merges all
 parallel non-graphical login sessions (text mode, ssh, cron, etc.), and up
 to one graphical session, into a single "user-session" or "super-session"
 within which all background D-Bus services are shared.
 .
 Multiple graphical sessions per user are not currently supported in this
 mode; as a result, it is particularly suitable for gdm, which responds to
 requests to open a parallel graphical session by switching to the existing
 graphical session and unlocking it.
 .
 To retain dbus' traditional session semantics, in which login sessions
 are artificially isolated from each other, remove this package and install
 dbus-x11 instead.
 .

Description-en: JavaScript's functional programming helper library
 Underscore is a utility-belt library for JavaScript that provides a lot
 of the functional programming support that you would expect in
 Prototype.js (or Ruby), but without extending any of the built-in
 JavaScript objects.  It's the tie to go along with jQuery's tux.
 .
 Underscore provides 60-odd functions that support both the usual
 functional suspects: map, select, invoke - as well as more specialized
 helpers: function binding, javascript templating, deep equality
 testing, and so on.  It delegates to built-in functions, if present, so
 modern browsers will use the native implementations of forEach, map,
 reduce, filter, every, some and indexOf.

 WinPR is released under the Apache license. Unlike Wine, WinPR does not provide
 binary compatibility, and does not require applications to be built for
 Windows. Instead, WinPR provides API compatibility for applications targeting
 non-Windows environments. When on Windows, the original native API is being
 used instead of the equivalent WinPR implementation, without having to modify
 the code using it.
 .
 This package contains the WinPR development files.

Package: python-swiftclient-doc

Description-en: Client library for Openstack Swift API - doc
 OpenStack Object Storage (code-named Swift) creates redundant, scalable object
 storage using clusters of standardized servers to store petabytes of
 accessible data. It is not a file system or real-time data storage system, but
 rather a long-term storage system for a more permanent type of static data
 that can be retrieved, leveraged, and then updated if necessary. Primary
 examples of data that best fit this type of storage model are virtual machine
 images, photo storage, email storage and backup archiving. Having no central
 "brain" or master point of control provides greater scalability, redundancy
 and permanence.
 .
 Objects are written to multiple hardware devices in the data center, with
 the OpenStack software responsible for ensuring data replication and
 integrity across the cluster. Storage clusters can scale horizontally by
 adding new nodes. Should a node fail, OpenStack works to replicate its
 content from other active nodes. Because OpenStack uses software logic to
 ensure data replication and distribution across different devices,
 inexpensive commodity hard drives and servers can be used in lieu of more
 expensive equipment.
 .
 This package provides a client for the OpenStack Swift API. There's a Python
 API  (the "swiftclient" module), and a command-line script ("swift").

Package: python3-swiftclient
Description-md5: c5b209ac95eaa56dda4413f8d356c96b
Description-en: Client library for Openstack Swift API - Python 3.x
 OpenStack Object Storage (code-named Swift) creates redundant, scalable object
 storage using clusters of standardized servers to store petabytes of
 accessible data. It is not a file system or real-time data storage system, but
 rather a long-term storage system for a more permanent type of static data
 that can be retrieved, leveraged, and then updated if necessary. Primary
 examples of data that best fit this type of storage model are virtual machine
 images, photo storage, email storage and backup archiving. Having no central
 "brain" or master point of control provides greater scalability, redundancy
 and permanence.
 .
 Objects are written to multiple hardware devices in the data center, with
 the OpenStack software responsible for ensuring data replication and
 integrity across the cluster. Storage clusters can scale horizontally by
 adding new nodes. Should a node fail, OpenStack works to replicate its
 content from other active nodes. Because OpenStack uses software logic to
 ensure data replication and distribution across different devices,
 inexpensive commodity hard drives and servers can be used in lieu of more
 expensive equipment.
 .
 This package provides a client for the OpenStack Swift API. There's a Python
 API  (the "swiftclient" module), and a command-line script ("swift").
 .
 This package contains the Python 3.x module.
